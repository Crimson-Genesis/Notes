what i was thinking to add the gamification into it and
the idea was to make the site like a real game, likeing like game to, create user like things happen in the dark soles game, the eill be a story which the site will follow, a main one the quest will be the question, which the user can be able to solve in any progeamming language and and will be side story, where the question will bit similar to the main story question but the question should be solved in a particular programming language (side story of python, or side story of c language), and the question will it self tell story, there will be a really powerfull ai and llm model, which will be hendling the story for each users, there will be one main lore or say main story, main sid storys and etc be that ai will make the experence for each user unique, 
and user can also add question to the site, so in that situation, the ai will make new really small side storys lore baseed on that  question, 
there will be a feture to connect the site to the github, where user can make really big projects in the repositorys, and the ctf site will be aboe to review it like, this major ctf are like raid bosses in the game, there people can colagrate with eachother to make the raid happen, 
there will be achivement system, reward system, really good art, dungons(this will be entire site it self), there will be really deep lores, there will be music, and in the main story, there will be a leaderboard for each question, and it will renk user based on the speed of solving the question, the time complixty, and the space complacty, and the majot factor in the ranking will be the more lower lenguage it is the higher the score multiplire, and for the cybersecurity question, there will ne ester eggs, and hidden treasers all around the site, which user can find and get achivments or rewards, there will be vim mode which will give the user 0.1 time score buff. and many many more features,
