### **Introduction to Supervised Learning**

---

#### 1. **Definition**

* Supervised Learning is a **machine learning paradigm** where an algorithm learns a **mapping function** from **input features** $X$ to **target outputs/labels** $Y$, using **labeled training data**.
* The model is "supervised" because it is trained with the correct answers.

$$
f: X \rightarrow Y
$$

---

#### 2. **Key Characteristics**

* **Labeled Data**: Each training example consists of an input-output pair $(x_i, y_i)$.
* **Feedback Loop**: The model receives feedback in the form of prediction errors to adjust its parameters.
* **Prediction Goal**: To predict output $Y$ for new, unseen input $X$.

### **Classification in Supervised Learning**

---

#### 1. **Definition**

* **Classification** is a type of supervised learning where the goal is to predict the **categorical class label** of new observations based on past observations.
* The output variable is **discrete** and belongs to a **finite set of classes**.

$$
f: X \rightarrow \{C_1, C_2, ..., C_k\}
$$

---

#### 2. **Types of Classification**

| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Binary Classification**     | Two possible output classes                  | Spam or Not Spam                       |
| **Multiclass Classification** | More than two classes                        | Digit recognition (0–9)                |
| **Multilabel Classification** | Each instance can belong to multiple classes | A movie can be both Comedy and Romance |

---

#### 3. **How Classification Works**

* The algorithm learns a **decision boundary** in the feature space that separates different classes.
* For a new instance, it predicts which side of the boundary it falls on, hence predicting the class.

### **Regression in Supervised Learning**

---

#### 1. **Definition**

* **Regression** is a supervised learning technique where the goal is to **predict a continuous numeric value** based on input features.

$$
f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$

---

#### 2. **Purpose**

  $$
  y = w_0 + w_1x + \epsilon
  $$
* **Multiple Linear Regression**:

  $$
  y = w_0 + w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + \cdots + w_nx_n + \epsilon
  $$

  where:

  $$

  * $y_i$: true value
  * $\hat{y}_i$: predicted value

| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**                | Penalizes larger errors more                |

### **k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) Algorithm**

---

#### 1. **Definition**

* **k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN)** is a **supervised learning algorithm** used for both **classification** and **regression**.
* It is a **non-parametric**, **instance-based** (or **lazy learning**) algorithm.
* The model makes predictions by **finding the k training examples closest** (most similar) to the new input and **uses them to determine the output**.

---

#### 2. **Key Idea**

* For a given query instance, look at the **k closest instances** in the training set:

  * For **classification**: use **majority voting**.
  * For **regression**: take the **average** of neighbors’ target values.

---

#### 3. **Working Steps**

2. **Calculate the distance** between the query point and all training points.
3. **Sort** the distances and find the **k nearest neighbors**.
4. For **classification**:

   * Count the class labels among the k neighbors.
   * Assign the class with the **highest frequency**.
5. For **regression**:

   * Compute the **mean** (or weighted average) of the k neighbors’ outputs.

---

#### 4. **Distance Metrics**

| Metric                 | Formula                                   | Usage                            |   |                    |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | - | ------------------ |
| **Euclidean Distance** | $\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - y_i)^2}$      | Most common; for continuous data |   |                    |
| **Manhattan Distance** | ( \sum\_{i=1}^{n}                         | x\_i - y\_i                      | ) | For grid-like data |
| **Minkowski Distance** | Generalization of Euclidean and Manhattan | Customizable                     |   |                    |

---

#### 5. **Choosing the Value of k**

| k Value               | Characteristics                                                              |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Small k (e.g., 1)** | Very sensitive to noise (overfitting)                                        |
| **Large k**           | Smoother decision boundary but may misclassify local patterns (underfitting) |
| **Odd k**             | Preferred in binary classification to avoid ties                             |

> Use **cross-validation** to find optimal value of k.

---

#### 6. **Advantages**

* **Simple** to implement and understand.
* No training phase — **lazy learner**.
* Naturally handles **multi-class problems**.
* Can be used for **both regression and classification**.

---

#### 7. **Disadvantages**

* **Slow prediction** time (computes distance to all points).
* **Memory intensive** (stores entire training dataset).
* Performance **degrades with high dimensions** (curse of dimensionality).
* **Sensitive to irrelevant features** and **feature scaling**.

---

#### 8. **Feature Scaling Requirement**

* k-NN is **distance-based**, so features must be on **comparable scales**.
* Apply:

  * **Normalization** (Min-Max scaling)
  * or **Standardization** (Z-score scaling)

---

#### 9. **Time and Space Complexity**

| Operation                           | Complexity                                              |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Training**                        | $O(1)$ — No actual training                             |
| **Prediction**                      | $O(n \cdot d)$ — Compare to all training samples, where |
| $n$ = number of training instances, |                                                         |
| $d$ = number of features            |                                                         |

### **Linear Models in Supervised Learning**

---

#### 1. **Definition**

* Linear models are a family of supervised learning algorithms that assume a **linear relationship** between the **input features** and the **target output**.
* They are used for **both regression and classification** tasks.

---

#### 2. **General Mathematical Form**

For input feature vector $x = [x_1, x_2, ..., x_n]$, the linear model makes predictions as:

$$
\hat{y} = w_0 + w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + \cdots + w_nx_n = w^T x + b
$$

* $w = [w_1, w_2, ..., w_n]$: weights (coefficients)
* $b = w_0$: bias (intercept)
* $\hat{y}$: predicted output

---

#### 3. **Types of Linear Models**

---

##### 3.1 **Linear Regression**

* **Used for**: Regression tasks (continuous output).
* **Objective**: Minimize the **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**.
* **Prediction**:

  $$
  \hat{y} = w^T x + b
  $$
* **Loss Function**:

  $$
  MSE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
  $$

---

##### 3.2 **Logistic Regression**

* **Used for**: Binary or multi-class classification.
* Applies a **sigmoid** function to linear output to estimate probability:

  $$
  \hat{p} = \sigma(w^T x + b) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(w^T x + b)}}
  $$
* **Class label**:

  $$
  \hat{y} = 
  \begin{cases}
  1 & \text{if } \hat{p} \geq 0.5 \\
  0 & \text{if } \hat{p} < 0.5
  \end{cases}
  $$
* **Loss Function**: Binary Cross-Entropy

  $$
  L = -[y\log(\hat{p}) + (1 - y)\log(1 - \hat{p})]
  $$

---

##### 3.3 **Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)**

* Adds penalty on the **squared** magnitude of coefficients.
* Helps prevent **overfitting**.

$$
\text{Loss} = MSE + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{n} w_j^2
$$

---

##### 3.4 **Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)**

* Adds penalty on the **absolute** magnitude of coefficients.
* Encourages **sparse solutions** (some weights become zero).

$$
\text{Loss} = MSE + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{n} |w_j|
$$

---

##### 3.5 **Elastic Net**

* Combines L1 and L2 regularization:

$$
\text{Loss} = MSE + \lambda_1 \sum |w_j| + \lambda_2 \sum w_j^2
$$

---

#### 4. **Advantages of Linear Models**

* **Simple** and easy to interpret.
* **Fast** training and prediction.
* Works well for **linearly separable** data.
* Efficient on **high-dimensional sparse data** (e.g., text).

---

#### 5. **Disadvantages**

* Assumes **linear relationship** between features and output.
* **Poor performance on non-linear** datasets.
* Sensitive to **outliers**.
* Requires **feature scaling** (especially with regularization).

---

#### 6. **Feature Scaling Requirement**

* Important for regularized linear models (Ridge, Lasso) and gradient-based optimization.
* Common methods:

  * **Standardization** (Z-score)
  * **Min-Max Normalization**

---

#### 7. **Applications**

* House price prediction (linear regression)
* Email spam classification (logistic regression)
* Credit risk scoring
* Text classification (e.g., sentiment analysis using logistic regression)

---

#### 8. **Decision Boundary (for Classification)**

* In logistic regression, the decision boundary is a **hyperplane**:

  $$
  w^T x + b = 0
  $$
* Divides the feature space into regions belonging to different classes.

---
### **Decision Trees**

---

#### 1. **Definition**

* A Decision Tree is a **tree-structured** model used for classification and regression.
* It recursively splits the input feature space into regions based on feature values, forming a hierarchy of decision nodes and leaf nodes.

---

#### 2. **Tree Structure**

* **Root Node**: The top decision node representing the entire dataset.
* **Decision (Internal) Nodes**: Nodes where the data is split based on a feature and a threshold (or category).
* **Leaf (Terminal) Nodes**: Nodes that assign a final prediction (class label for classification, numeric value for regression).

---

#### 3. **How Splits Are Chosen**

* At each internal node, the algorithm selects the **feature** and **split point** that best separates the data according to a **purity criterion**.

##### a. **Classification Criteria**

* **Gini Impurity**

  $$
  G = 1 - \sum_{i=1}^{C} p_i^2
  $$

  where $p_i$ is the proportion of class $i$ in the node.

* **Entropy (Information Gain)**

  $$
  H = -\sum_{i=1}^{C} p_i \log_2 p_i
  $$

  **Information Gain** = Entropy(parent) – Weighted sum of Entropy(children)

##### b. **Regression Criteria**

* **Mean Squared Error (MSE) Reduction**
  Choose splits that minimize the MSE within child nodes.

---

#### 4. **Building the Tree (Algorithm)**

1. Start at the **root** with all training data.
2. For each feature, evaluate all possible splits and compute the chosen impurity measure.
3. Select the split (feature & threshold) that **maximizes purity gain** (or minimizes error).
4. Partition the data into two subsets.
5. Recursively repeat steps 2–4 on each subset until a **stopping condition** is met:

   * Maximum tree depth reached
   * Minimum number of samples in a node
   * No further impurity reduction

---

#### 5. **Stopping Criteria & Pruning**

* **Pre-pruning (Early Stopping)**

  * Limit tree depth
  * Require a minimum number of samples to split
  * Require a minimum impurity decrease

* **Post-pruning**

  * Grow full tree, then prune back nodes that add little predictive power.
  * Methods: Cost-Complexity Pruning (prune branches with smallest increase in error per complexity increase).

---

#### 6. **Advantages**

* **Interpretable**: Tree structure is easy to visualize and understand.
* **Handles mixed data**: Works with both numerical and categorical features.
* **Non-parametric**: No assumption about data distribution.
* **Requires little data preparation**: No need for feature scaling or normalization.

---

#### 7. **Disadvantages**

* **Overfitting**: Trees can become very deep and fit noise in the data.
* **High variance**: Small changes in data can lead to different splits and tree structures.
* **Bias in splits**: Features with many levels (categories) can dominate splits.
* **Greedy algorithm**: Only finds local optimum splits, not global optimum.

---

#### 8. **Improvements via Ensembles**

* **Random Forests**

  * Build multiple trees on bootstrapped data samples with random feature subsets.
  * Aggregate predictions (majority vote or average) to reduce overfitting and variance.
* **Gradient Boosted Trees (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)**

  * Sequentially build trees where each tree corrects errors of the previous ensemble.
  * Highly accurate and widely used in structured-data competitions.

---

#### 9. **Applications**

* Customer churn prediction
* Credit scoring
* Medical diagnosis
* Fraud detection
* Feature importance estimation

---
### **Naive Bayes Classifiers**

---

#### 1. **Definition**

* Naive Bayes is a **probabilistic classifier** based on **Bayes’ Theorem** with the **naive assumption** that all input features are **independent** given the class label.
* It is used mainly for **classification tasks**.

---

#### 2. **Bayes’ Theorem**

$$
P(C|X) = \frac{P(X|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(X)}
$$

Where:

* $P(C|X)$: Posterior probability of class $C$ given data $X$
* $P(X|C)$: Likelihood of data $X$ given class $C$
* $P(C)$: Prior probability of class $C$
* $P(X)$: Evidence (constant for all classes during classification)

---

#### 3. **Naive Assumption**

* The features $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ are assumed to be **conditionally independent** given the class $C$:

$$
P(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n|C) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i|C)
$$

This drastically simplifies the computation.

---

#### 4. **Prediction Rule**

Choose the class $C$ that **maximizes** the posterior probability:

$$
\hat{C} = \arg\max_C P(C) \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i|C)
$$

---

#### 5. **Types of Naive Bayes Classifiers**

---

##### 5.1 **Gaussian Naive Bayes**

* Assumes features follow a **normal distribution**.
* Suitable for **continuous** data.

$$
P(x_i|C) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{(x_i - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
$$

---

##### 5.2 **Multinomial Naive Bayes**

* Used for **count-based** features (e.g., word frequencies in documents).
* Common in **text classification**.

$$
P(x_i|C) = \frac{(\theta_{ci})^{x_i}}{x_i!} e^{-\theta_{ci}}
$$

---

##### 5.3 **Bernoulli Naive Bayes**

* For **binary/boolean features** (0 or 1).
* Suitable when features are binary presence/absence flags.

---

#### 6. **Advantages**

* **Simple and fast** to train.
* Performs well on **high-dimensional** data (e.g., text).
* Requires **less training data** than more complex models.
* **Robust to irrelevant features**.
* **No need for feature scaling**.

---

#### 7. **Disadvantages**

* The **naive assumption** (feature independence) is rarely true in real-world data.
* Can be **outperformed** by more complex models when feature interactions are significant.
* For **continuous variables**, performance depends heavily on distribution assumptions.

---

#### 8. **Zero Probability Problem**

* If a feature value never appears in training data for a class, it can assign **zero probability**, making the whole posterior zero.
* **Solution**: Use **Laplace Smoothing** (Add-1 Smoothing)

$$
P(x_i|C) = \frac{\text{count}(x_i, C) + 1}{\text{count}(C) + k}
$$

Where $k$ is the number of possible feature values.

---

#### 9. **Applications**

* Spam email detection
* Sentiment analysis
* Document classification
* Disease diagnosis
* News categorization

---
### **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

---

#### 1. **Definition**

* **Support Vector Machine** is a **supervised learning algorithm** used primarily for **binary classification**, and also for **multiclass classification** and **regression (SVR)**.
* It aims to find the **optimal hyperplane** that best separates data points of different classes with the **maximum margin**.

---

#### 2. **Key Concepts**

---

##### a. **Hyperplane**

* A decision boundary that separates classes.
* In 2D: a line
* In 3D: a plane
* In $n$-dimensional space: a hyperplane

$$
w^T x + b = 0
$$

---

##### b. **Margin**

* The **distance** between the hyperplane and the nearest data points (called **support vectors**) from both classes.
* SVM **maximizes this margin** for better generalization.

---

##### c. **Support Vectors**

* Data points **closest to the hyperplane**.
* These are **critical** to defining the decision boundary.

---

#### 3. **Mathematical Objective (Hard Margin SVM)**

Given linearly separable data:

$$
\text{Minimize} \quad \frac{1}{2} \|w\|^2
$$

Subject to:

$$
y_i(w^T x_i + b) \geq 1 \quad \text{for all } i
$$

Where:

* $x_i$: input vector
* $y_i \in \{-1, +1\}$: class label
* $w$: weight vector
* $b$: bias

---

#### 4. **Soft Margin SVM**

* Introduces **slack variables** $\xi_i$ to allow some misclassification for **non-linearly separable** data.
* Trade-off between **margin size** and **classification error** controlled by parameter $C$.

$$
\text{Minimize} \quad \frac{1}{2} \|w\|^2 + C \sum_{i=1}^{n} \xi_i
$$

Subject to:

$$
y_i(w^T x_i + b) \geq 1 - \xi_i, \quad \xi_i \geq 0
$$

---

#### 5. **Kernel Trick (for Non-Linear SVM)**

* Maps input data into **higher-dimensional space** using a **kernel function** without explicitly computing the transformation.
* Allows SVM to **fit non-linear boundaries**.

Common Kernels:

| Kernel             | Function                                |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **Linear**         | $K(x, x') = x^T x'$                     |
| **Polynomial**     | $K(x, x') = (x^T x' + c)^d$             |
| **RBF (Gaussian)** | $K(x, x') = \exp(-\gamma \|x - x'\|^2)$ |
| **Sigmoid**        | $K(x, x') = \tanh(\alpha x^T x' + c)$   |

---

#### 6. **Regularization Parameter (C)**

* Controls the **trade-off between maximizing margin and minimizing error**.

  * **Large C**: Less margin, fewer misclassifications (may overfit).
  * **Small C**: Larger margin, more tolerance for errors (may underfit).

---

#### 7. **Advantages**

* Works well in **high-dimensional spaces**.
* Effective when the number of features > number of samples.
* Can model **non-linear decision boundaries** using kernel trick.
* **Robust to overfitting**, especially with proper regularization.

---

#### 8. **Disadvantages**

* **Computationally expensive** for large datasets.
* **Not suitable for noisy datasets** (e.g., overlapping classes).
* Choosing the **right kernel** and tuning hyperparameters ($C$, $\gamma$) can be complex.
* No direct probability outputs (can be added via Platt scaling).

---

#### 9. **Applications**

* Text classification (e.g., spam detection)
* Image recognition
* Bioinformatics (e.g., cancer classification from gene data)
* Handwriting digit recognition (MNIST)
* Face detection

---

### **Soft Margin in Support Vector Machines (SVM)**

---

#### 1. **Definition**

* A **Soft Margin** SVM allows some **misclassification or violations of the margin** in order to handle **non-linearly separable** datasets or data with **noise**.
* Introduces **flexibility** into the strict "hard margin" constraint by permitting **errors** via **slack variables**.

---

#### 2. **Why Soft Margin is Needed**

* Real-world data is rarely perfectly linearly separable.
* A **Hard Margin SVM** requires that all data be separated **without error**, which is not always possible or desirable (can **overfit**).
* Soft Margin allows some misclassified points but **penalizes** them in the objective function.

---

#### 3. **Key Concepts**

---

##### a. **Slack Variables** $\xi_i$

* Quantify how much the $i^{th}$ data point violates the margin.
* $\xi_i = 0$: correctly classified and outside the margin
* $0 < \xi_i < 1$: inside the margin but correctly classified
* $\xi_i > 1$: misclassified point

---

##### b. **Regularization Parameter** $C$

* Controls the trade-off between **maximizing margin** and **minimizing classification error**.
* High $C$: Less tolerant to misclassification (narrow margin, may overfit)
* Low $C$: More tolerant (wider margin, may underfit)

---

#### 4. **Mathematical Formulation**

$$
\text{Minimize} \quad \frac{1}{2} \|w\|^2 + C \sum_{i=1}^{n} \xi_i
$$

Subject to:

$$
y_i(w^T x_i + b) \geq 1 - \xi_i \quad \text{and} \quad \xi_i \geq 0
$$

Where:

* $\xi_i$: slack variable for $i^{th}$ sample
* $C$: regularization constant
* $w$: weight vector
* $b$: bias term
* $y_i$: class label
* $x_i$: input vector

---

#### 5. **Interpretation**

* The objective function has **two goals**:

  * **Maximize the margin** $\Rightarrow \min \frac{1}{2} \|w\|^2$
  * **Minimize total misclassification** penalty $\Rightarrow C \sum \xi_i$

---

#### 6. **Geometric Meaning**

* Instead of forcing all points to stay **outside the margin**, Soft Margin allows some to be **inside or on the wrong side**, based on how much slack is permitted.
* These violations are controlled and penalized rather than rejected.

---

#### 7. **Effect of Parameter $C$**

| Value of $C$  | Behavior                                                                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Large $C$** | SVM focuses on minimizing misclassification (smaller margin, possibly overfits) |
| **Small $C$** | SVM allows more margin violations (wider margin, better generalization)         |

---

#### 8. **Advantages of Soft Margin**

* Can handle **non-linearly separable** data.
* More **robust to noise and outliers**.
* Provides a **balance** between margin size and misclassification.

---

#### 9. **Use Cases**

* Image classification with noise
* Text categorization where some overlap between classes exists
* Any real-world problem where perfect separation is unrealistic

---
### **Non-Linear SVM Classification**

---

#### 1. **Definition**

* **Non-Linear SVM** extends standard (linear) SVM to handle datasets that **are not linearly separable** in the original input space.
* It uses the **kernel trick** to **implicitly map** data into a higher-dimensional feature space where a **linear hyperplane** can separate the classes.

---

#### 2. **Why Non-Linear SVM is Needed**

* In many real-world problems, data is **not linearly separable**.
* A linear SVM would either fail to classify correctly or **overfit** by forcing a linear boundary.
* Non-linear SVMs overcome this by finding **non-linear decision boundaries**.

---

#### 3. **The Kernel Trick**

* Instead of computing transformation $\phi(x)$ explicitly, the kernel trick computes the **dot product** in the transformed space using a **kernel function**:

$$
K(x, x') = \langle \phi(x), \phi(x') \rangle
$$

* This allows efficient computation in **very high (even infinite) dimensional** spaces.

---

#### 4. **Common Kernel Functions**

| Kernel             | Formula                                 | Description                                                      |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Linear**         | $K(x, x') = x^T x'$                     | No transformation (same as linear SVM)                           |
| **Polynomial**     | $K(x, x') = (x^T x' + c)^d$             | Maps to polynomial feature space                                 |
| **RBF (Gaussian)** | $K(x, x') = \exp(-\gamma \|x - x'\|^2)$ | Maps to infinite-dimensional space, great for complex boundaries |
| **Sigmoid**        | $K(x, x') = \tanh(\alpha x^T x' + c)$   | Similar to neural networks                                       |

---

#### 5. **Decision Function**

After training, the decision function for a new point $x$ is:

$$
f(x) = \text{sign}\left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i y_i K(x_i, x) + b \right)
$$

* $x_i$: support vectors
* $\alpha_i$: learned weights
* $y_i$: class labels
* $K$: kernel function
* $b$: bias

---

#### 6. **Parameters to Tune**

| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $C$       | Regularization parameter (controls margin–error trade-off)                                          |
| $\gamma$  | Kernel coefficient in RBF and Polynomial kernels (controls influence of individual training points) |
| $d$       | Degree of the polynomial (for polynomial kernel)                                                    |

---

#### 7. **Advantages**

* Can handle **complex, non-linear** boundaries.
* **Highly flexible** due to choice of kernels.
* Effective in **high-dimensional** spaces.
* Works well when the number of features > number of samples.

---

#### 8. **Disadvantages**

* **Slower training** on large datasets (non-linear kernels are computationally expensive).
* **Model interpretability** is low compared to linear SVM or decision trees.
* **Choice of kernel and hyperparameters** critically affects performance.
* Not suitable for **very large** datasets unless optimized.

---

#### 9. **Applications**

* Face detection (e.g., with RBF kernel)
* Bioinformatics (e.g., protein classification)
* Text categorization and sentiment analysis

---

---

#### 2. **Basic Structure**

A typical neural network has:

| **Output Layer**  | Produces final prediction (class or regression value)          |

Each **neuron** computes:

$$
z = w^T x + b, \quad a = \phi(z)
$$

Where:

* $x$: input vector

---

#### 3. **Forward Propagation**

* Data passes from **input to output**, layer by layer.
* At each neuron, a **weighted sum** is computed and passed through a **non-linear activation function**.

---

#### 4. **Activation Functions**

#### 5. **Training a Neural Network**

##### a. **Loss Function**

$$

Where:

---

#### 6. **Hyperparameters**

| Parameter                    | Role                                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

---
### **The Perceptron**

---

#### 1. **Definition**

* The **Perceptron** is the **simplest type of neural network**, introduced by **Frank Rosenblatt in 1958**.
* It is a **binary linear classifier** that maps input features to a single output using a **step activation function**.
* It forms the **building block of more complex neural networks**.

---

#### 2. **Architecture**

* A single **layer of neurons** with:

  * **Input vector** $x = [x_1, x_2, ..., x_n]$
  * **Weight vector** $w = [w_1, w_2, ..., w_n]$
  * **Bias** term $b$
  * **Activation function**: typically a **step function**

$$
z = w^T x + b
$$

$$
\hat{y} = 
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } z \geq 0 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

---

#### 3. **Perceptron Algorithm**

##### a. **Initialization**

* Randomly initialize weights $w$ and bias $b$

##### b. **For each training example** $(x_i, y_i)$:

1. **Compute output**:

   $$
   \hat{y}_i = \text{step}(w^T x_i + b)
   $$

2. **Update weights** (if prediction is wrong):

   $$
   w := w + \eta (y_i - \hat{y}_i) x_i
   $$

   $$
   b := b + \eta (y_i - \hat{y}_i)
   $$

Where:

* $\eta$: learning rate
* $y_i$: true label
* $\hat{y}_i$: predicted label

##### c. **Repeat** until convergence (or max epochs)

---

#### 4. **Geometric Interpretation**

* Learns a **linear decision boundary** (hyperplane) that separates the two classes.
* Works only if the data is **linearly separable**.

---

#### 5. **Limitations**

* **Cannot solve non-linearly separable problems**, e.g., XOR problem.
* Uses a **hard step function** (non-differentiable), so it **cannot be trained with gradient-based methods**.
* Not suitable for **multi-class problems** (without modifications).

---

#### 6. **Advantages**

* **Simple** and fast to implement.
* Works well for **linearly separable binary classification** tasks.
* Can be extended to **multi-layer perceptron (MLP)** for complex problems.

---

#### 7. **Improvements in Later Models**

---

#### 8. **Applications (Limited)**

* Educational tool to introduce neural networks

---
### **Activation Functions**

---

#### 1. **Definition**

* An **activation function** introduces **non-linearity** into the neural network.
* It transforms the **input signal** of a neuron into an **output signal** that is passed to the next layer.
* Without activation functions, neural networks would behave like **linear models**, regardless of their depth.

---

#### 2. **Why Activation Functions Are Needed**

* To model **complex, non-linear relationships**.
* To enable the network to **learn diverse patterns** in data.
* To allow **deep networks** to approximate any function (Universal Approximation Theorem).

---

#### 3. **Types of Activation Functions**

---

### **A. Step Function**

* **Definition**: Binary output (0 or 1) depending on input sign.

$$
f(z) = 
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } z \geq 0 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

* **Used in**: Original Perceptron
* **Disadvantages**: Not differentiable, unsuitable for gradient-based training

---

### **B. Sigmoid Function**

* **Formula**:

$$
f(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}
$$

* **Range**: (0, 1)
* **Properties**:

  * Smooth curve
  * Useful for **probabilistic outputs**
* **Problems**:

  * **Vanishing gradient** for large |z|
  * Not zero-centered

---

### **C. Hyperbolic Tangent (Tanh)**

* **Formula**:

$$
f(z) = \tanh(z) = \frac{e^z - e^{-z}}{e^z + e^{-z}}
$$

* **Range**: (−1, 1)
* **Properties**:

  * Zero-centered output
  * Still suffers from vanishing gradients for large |z|

---

### **D. Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)**

* **Formula**:

$$
f(z) = \max(0, z)
$$

* **Range**: \[0, ∞)
* **Properties**:

  * Computationally efficient
  * Speeds up convergence
  * Sparse activation (some neurons output 0)
* **Problems**:

  * **Dying ReLU problem**: neurons can get stuck with 0 output if they fall into negative input region and never recover

---

### **E. Leaky ReLU**

* **Formula**:

$$
f(z) = 
\begin{cases}
z & \text{if } z > 0 \\
\alpha z & \text{if } z \leq 0
\end{cases}
\quad \text{(typically } \alpha = 0.01\text{)}
$$

* **Fixes dying ReLU** by allowing a small gradient when $z < 0$

---

### **F. Parametric ReLU (PReLU)**

* Like Leaky ReLU, but $\alpha$ is a learnable parameter.

---

### **G. Exponential Linear Unit (ELU)**

* **Formula**:

$$
f(z) = 
\begin{cases}
z & \text{if } z > 0 \\
\alpha (e^z - 1) & \text{if } z \leq 0
\end{cases}
$$

* Improves learning characteristics by allowing negative outputs and zero-centered activations.

---

### **H. Softmax Function**

* **Formula** (for multi-class classification):

$$
f(z_i) = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_{j} e^{z_j}}
$$

* **Range**: (0, 1), sum to 1
* Converts raw output scores into **probability distribution**
* Used in **output layer** for **multi-class classification**

---

#### 4. **Comparison Summary**

| Function   | Range   | Differentiable  | Used in                   |
| ---------- | ------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |

| Softmax    | (0, 1)  | Yes             | Output layer (multiclass) |

---

#### 5. **Selection Guidelines**

* **ReLU**: Default for hidden layers in deep networks
* **Tanh/Sigmoid**: Good for shallow nets; rarely used in deep nets due to vanishing gradients
* **Leaky ReLU/ELU**: Preferred when ReLU suffers from dying neurons
* **Softmax**: Always used in the output layer of **multi-class classification**

---

#### 3. **Phases of Neural Network Training**

| Phase                               | Description                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Forward Pass**                    | Input data flows through the network layer by layer to generate predictions. |
| **Loss Computation**                | Error is calculated using a loss function (e.g., MSE or Cross-Entropy).      |
| **Backward Pass (Backpropagation)** | Gradients of the loss are calculated with respect to each weight.            |
| **Weight Update**                   | Weights are updated using gradient descent or a variant.                     |

---

#### 4. **Mathematical Foundation**

Let:

* $a^{[l]}$: activation of layer $l$
* $z^{[l]} = W^{[l]} a^{[l-1]} + b^{[l]}$: pre-activation
* $L$: loss function
* $\delta^{[l]}$: error term (gradient of loss w\.r.t. $z^{[l]}$)

---

##### a. **Compute Error at Output Layer**

If output activation is $a^{[L]}$ and true output is $y$:

$$
\delta^{[L]} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial a^{[L]}} \cdot \phi'(z^{[L]})
$$

---

##### b. **Backpropagate Error to Previous Layers**

For layer $l$ from $L-1$ to 1:

$$
\delta^{[l]} = \left( W^{[l+1]^T} \delta^{[l+1]} \right) \cdot \phi'(z^{[l]})
$$

---

##### c. **Compute Gradients**

$$
\frac{\partial L}{\partial W^{[l]}} = \delta^{[l]} \cdot a^{[l-1]^T}
$$

$$
\frac{\partial L}{\partial b^{[l]}} = \delta^{[l]}
$$

---

#### 5. **Weight Update Rule (Gradient Descent)**

$$
W^{[l]} := W^{[l]} - \eta \cdot \frac{\partial L}{\partial W^{[l]}}
$$

$$
b^{[l]} := b^{[l]} - \eta \cdot \frac{\partial L}{\partial b^{[l]}}
$$

Where:

* $L$: total loss

---

#### 6. **Example Flow for One Training Example**

2. Compute **loss**.
3. Start from the **output layer**, calculate $\delta$ using derivative of loss and activation.
4. Move **layer by layer backward**, computing gradients.
5. Use gradients to **update weights and biases**.

---

#### 7. **Importance of Activation Function Derivatives**

| Function | Derivative                              |
| -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Sigmoid  | $\sigma'(z) = \sigma(z)(1 - \sigma(z))$ |
| Tanh     | $1 - \tanh^2(z)$                        |
| ReLU     | $1$ if $z > 0$, else $0$                |

Backprop relies heavily on these **partial derivatives**.

---

#### 8. **Limitations**

* **Target Labels** $y$: Desired output for each input (e.g., class, value).
* **Split Dataset**:

  * **Training set**: used to update model weights.
  * **Validation set**: monitors performance on unseen data.
  * **Test set**: evaluates final performance (after training).

---

### **Step 2: Initialize the Network**

  * **Number of layers** (depth)
  * **Number of neurons per layer**
  * **Activation functions** (e.g., ReLU, Softmax)
* Randomly initialize:

  * **Weights** $W \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$
  * **Biases** $b = 0$ or small constants

---

### **Step 3: Forward Propagation**

For each layer $l$:

$$
z^{[l]} = W^{[l]} a^{[l-1]} + b^{[l]}
$$

$$
a^{[l]} = \phi(z^{[l]})
$$

* **Last layer** activation depends on task:

  * **Sigmoid / Softmax** for classification
  * **Linear** for regression

---

### **Step 4: Compute the Loss**

L = -\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i \log(\hat{y}_i)
$$

---

### **Step 5: Backpropagation**

* Compute **gradients** of the loss w\.r.t. each weight and bias using **chain rule**.
* Use **activation function derivatives** and loss derivatives.

For each layer (in reverse):

$$
\delta^{[l]} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial z^{[l]}} = \left( W^{[l+1]^T} \delta^{[l+1]} \right) \cdot \phi'(z^{[l]})
$$

---

### **Step 6: Update Weights**

Using gradient descent or an optimizer (e.g., Adam):

$$
W^{[l]} := W^{[l]} - \eta \cdot \frac{\partial L}{\partial W^{[l]}}
$$

$$
b^{[l]} := b^{[l]} - \eta \cdot \frac{\partial L}{\partial b^{[l]}}
$$

Where $\eta$ is the **learning rate**.

---

### **Step 7: Iterate Over Epochs**

* An **epoch** = 1 full pass over the training dataset.
* Use **mini-batch gradient descent** (split data into small batches) for efficiency.
* Continue for multiple epochs until:

  * Convergence (loss stops decreasing)
  * Early stopping criteria is met (validation loss increases)

$$

$$
a^{[l]} = \phi(z^{[l]})
$$

* **Activation functions** are applied:

$$
\hat{y} = \arg\max_j \left( \text{softmax}_j(z^{[L]}) \right)
$$

* **Regression**:

  * Output is a continuous value directly from the final neuron

    ```
  * **PyTorch**:

    ```python
    output = model(input_tensor)
    ```

---

### **Step 5: Postprocess the Output**

```

---

### **Step 6: Use Predictions**

### **The Number of Hidden Layers in a Neural Network**

---

#### 1. **Definition**

* **Hidden layers** are the layers between the input and output layers in a neural network.
* They perform **non-linear transformations** on inputs to learn **complex patterns**.
* Choosing the **right number of hidden layers** is crucial for the network’s performance and generalization ability.

---

#### 2. **Role of Hidden Layers**

* Allow the network to model **non-linear relationships** between input and output.
* Each layer adds a level of **abstraction**:

  * Lower layers learn **simple features**.
  * Higher layers learn **complex combinations** of lower-level features.

---

#### 3. **General Guidelines**

| Layers                    | Suitable For                                                           |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **0**                     | Linear models (e.g., linear/logistic regression)                       |
| **1 (shallow network)**   | Simple problems with linear or moderately non-linear data              |
| **2–3**                   | Most real-world problems with moderate complexity                      |
| **4–10+ (deep networks)** | Highly complex problems like image recognition, NLP, time-series, etc. |

---

#### 4. **Universal Approximation Theorem**

* States that a **single hidden layer** with enough neurons can **approximate any continuous function** on compact subsets of ℝⁿ.
* However, in practice:

  * **More layers** = more efficient at representing functions with fewer neurons
  * **Deeper networks** generalize better for certain tasks

---

#### 5. **Factors That Influence the Number of Hidden Layers**

---

### **A. Complexity of the Task**

* Simple decision boundaries → fewer layers
* Complex patterns (e.g., images, language) → more layers

---

### **B. Amount of Training Data**

* Large data supports deeper models
* Small data → prefer shallow networks to avoid overfitting

---

### **C. Feature Space**

* Low-dimensional input (e.g., 2–3 features) → fewer layers
* High-dimensional data (e.g., images, text embeddings) → more layers

---

### **D. Computational Resources**

* More layers → more parameters → higher **training time**, **memory usage**, **inference latency**

---

#### 6. **Risks of Improper Hidden Layer Choices**

| Too Few Layers                | Too Many Layers                       |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Underfitting                  | Overfitting                           |
| Poor accuracy                 | Longer training time                  |
| Cannot model complex patterns | Risk of vanishing/exploding gradients |

---

#### 7. **Typical Hidden Layer Counts by Application**

| Task                              | Common Hidden Layers |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Simple classification (e.g., XOR) | 1                    |
| Tabular data                      | 1–3                  |
| Image classification (CNNs)       | 5–100+               |
| NLP (RNNs, Transformers)          | 6–24                 |
| Deep Reinforcement Learning       | 2–5                  |

---

#### 8. **Architecture Examples**

  * Good for linearly separable or simple non-linear problems
* **2–3 hidden layers**:

  * Often sufficient for most problems
* **10+ layers (deep)**:

  * Needed for hierarchical feature extraction (e.g., CNNs, DNNs in vision/NLP)

---

* Combine with **dropout, batch normalization**, and **early stopping** to avoid overfitting in deep networks
* Use tools like **grid/random search** to automate hidden layer tuning

---

### **Visual Cortex Architecture**

---

#### 1. **Definition**

* The **visual cortex architecture** refers to the **biological inspiration** behind **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.
* It models how the **human visual system**, particularly the **primary visual cortex (V1)**, processes visual information through **hierarchical layers**.

---

#### 2. **Biological Basis: Human Visual Cortex**

* Located in the **occipital lobe** of the brain.
* Processes input from the **retina** in **multiple stages**.
* Different **neurons respond to different visual features**:

  * **Edges**, **lines**, **angles**, **motion**, **depth**, **colors**.

---

#### 3. **Receptive Fields**

* Each neuron in the visual cortex responds only to a **specific region** of the visual field — called a **receptive field**.
* Neurons at **lower levels** respond to **simple features** (e.g., lines, edges).
* Neurons at **higher levels** respond to **complex patterns** (e.g., faces, objects).

---

#### 4. **Hierarchy of Processing**

| Level        | Biological Cortex                      | CNN Equivalent      | Role                              |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Layer 1**  | Simple cells in V1                     | Convolution layer 1 | Detects edges, orientations       |
| **Layer 2**  | Complex cells                          | Convolution layer 2 | Combines edges into shapes        |
| **Layer 3+** | Higher-level visual areas (V2, V4, IT) | Deeper CNN layers   | Detects objects, scenes, patterns |

---

#### 5. **Key Components in CNNs Inspired by Visual Cortex**

---

### **A. Convolutional Filters**

* Mimic **simple cells** detecting specific patterns (e.g., vertical or horizontal lines).
* Learn filters via training to **capture visual features**.

---

### **B. Shared Weights**

* Biological neurons use similar feature detectors **across visual space**.
* In CNNs, **filters (kernels)** are applied **across the entire image**, enabling spatial feature detection with fewer parameters.

---

### **C. Local Connectivity**

* Just like neurons in the cortex connect only to nearby cells, CNN neurons are **locally connected** (not fully connected).
* Each neuron **looks at a small patch** (receptive field) of the previous layer.

---

### **D. Hierarchical Composition**

* The brain builds up from **edges → shapes → objects**.
* CNNs do the same using **stacked convolution and pooling layers**.

---

### **E. Pooling (Subsampling)**

* Biological systems **ignore minor shifts/variations** in object appearance.
* Pooling layers (e.g., **max pooling**) help with **translation invariance**.

---

#### 6. **Advantages of Visual Cortex-Inspired Architecture**

* **Parameter efficiency** through weight sharing.
* **Translation invariance** via pooling.
* **Effective feature hierarchy** via deep stacking.
* Suitable for **image**, **video**, and **spatial** data.

---

#### 7. **Limitations of the Analogy**

| Limitation                          | Explanation                                                         |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Simplified**                      | CNNs are still much simpler than biological visual systems          |
| **No lateral/feedback connections** | The real brain has recurrent and lateral interactions               |
| **No motion/time**                  | CNNs process static images; biological vision handles dynamic input |
| **Fixed architecture**              | The brain is adaptive, whereas CNNs have fixed layer structures     |

---

#### 8. **Modern CNNs and Visual Cortex Inspiration**

* Architectures like **VGGNet**, **ResNet**, and **Inception** extend the idea of layered feature extraction.
* **Deep learning** continues to take cues from neuroscience to build more efficient and biologically plausible models (e.g., capsule networks, spiking neural networks).

---

### **Convolution Layers**

---

#### 1. **Definition**

* A **convolution layer** is a core component of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** used for **extracting spatial features** from input data like images.
* It applies **learnable filters (kernels)** to input data to produce **feature maps** that highlight important patterns such as **edges, textures, shapes**, etc.

---

#### 2. **Purpose**

* To **automatically detect features** in the input using filters.
* To **preserve spatial relationships** by learning image patterns at various locations.

---

#### 3. **Working Principle**

* Given:

  * Input image: 2D matrix of pixel values
  * Filter (kernel): small matrix (e.g., 3×3, 5×5)

* The **filter slides** (convolves) across the image and performs **element-wise multiplication and summation**:

$$
\text{Output}(i, j) = \sum_{m} \sum_{n} \text{Input}(i+m, j+n) \cdot \text{Filter}(m,n)
$$

---

#### 4. **Important Parameters**

| Parameter                     | Description                                                       |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Filter Size (Kernel Size)** | Common sizes: 3×3, 5×5                                            |
| **Stride**                    | How many pixels the filter moves at a time                        |
| **Padding**                   | Adding extra border to preserve input size (e.g., zero-padding)   |
| **Number of Filters**         | Defines number of output feature maps                             |
| **Dilation**                  | Expands kernel by inserting zeros (used in semantic segmentation) |

---

#### 5. **Example**

* Input: 6×6 image
* Filter: 3×3
* Stride: 1
* Padding: 0
* Output size = $(6 - 3)/1 + 1 = 4$ → output = 4×4 feature map

---

#### 6. **Multiple Filters**

* Each filter detects **different features** (e.g., vertical edges, horizontal edges, curves).
* With 32 filters, the output is **32 feature maps** stacked together.

---

#### 7. **Activation Function (after convolution)**

* Non-linearity is introduced by applying an **activation function** (usually **ReLU**) on each element of the output feature map.

$$
\text{Output} = \text{ReLU}(\text{Convolution Result})
$$

---

#### 8. **Padding Types**

| Type                    | Effect                                                |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Valid (no padding)**  | Output size is smaller than input                     |
| **Same (zero padding)** | Output size = input size                              |
| **Full**                | Pads to allow filter to fit completely around borders |

---

#### 9. **Stacking Convolution Layers**

* Deeper convolution layers capture:

  * **Low-level features** in early layers (edges, lines)
  * **High-level features** in deeper layers (shapes, faces)

---

#### 10. **Advantages**

* **Sparse connectivity** (filter only connects to local region)
* **Parameter sharing** (same weights across different spatial locations)
* **Efficient learning** of spatial hierarchies

---

#### 11. **Visualization**

* Filters can be visualized as grayscale patches.
* Feature maps show **what the model focuses on** at each layer.

---

#### 12. **Mathematical Summary**

Let:

* $x$: input
* $W$: filter weights
* $b$: bias
* $*$: convolution operator

Then:

$$
z = x * W + b
$$

$$
a = \phi(z)
$$

---
### **Filter (Kernel) in Convolutional Neural Networks**

---

#### 1. **Definition**

* A **filter** (also called a **kernel**) is a **small matrix of weights** that slides over the input data (e.g., an image) to **extract features** during the convolution operation.
* Filters are **learned automatically** during training and are essential for detecting **patterns** such as edges, corners, textures, and complex shapes.

---

#### 2. **Role of Filters**

* Extract **local features** by computing dot products with small patches of the input.
* Different filters **specialize** in detecting different types of features.
* Filters enable **feature hierarchy**:

  * Early layers: low-level features (edges, textures)
  * Deeper layers: high-level features (eyes, faces, objects)

---

#### 3. **Structure of a Filter**

* Typically a **small 2D or 3D matrix**:

  * Common sizes: **3×3**, **5×5**, **7×7**
  * 3D in the case of multi-channel input (e.g., RGB images)

Example:

* 3×3 filter:

  $$
  \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & 0 & -1 \\
  1 & 0 & -1 \\
  1 & 0 & -1
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$

  (This detects vertical edges)

---

#### 4. **Filter Operation (Convolution)**

* The filter **slides (convolves)** across the input matrix.
* At each step:

  * The filter overlaps with a patch of the input.
  * Perform **element-wise multiplication** between the filter and input patch.
  * Sum the results and output a **single number** to the output feature map.

---

#### 5. **Learned vs. Handcrafted Filters**

* In traditional image processing (like Sobel, Prewitt), filters are **manually designed**.
* In CNNs, **filters are learned** from data via **backpropagation** and **gradient descent**.

---

#### 6. **Number of Filters in a Convolutional Layer**

* A convolutional layer can use **multiple filters**:

  * If a layer has 64 filters → it outputs 64 **feature maps**.
* Each filter focuses on a **distinct pattern**.

---

#### 7. **Filter Depth**

* If input has multiple channels (e.g., RGB with 3 channels), each filter will have the same depth:

  * For 3-channel image input: filter shape = $3 \times 3 \times 3$
* The filter spans all input channels but only a **small spatial region**.

---

#### 8. **Effect of Filter Size**

| Filter Size | Effect                                                       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1×1         | Reduces depth, used for dimensionality reduction             |
| 3×3         | Most common, good balance of detail and efficiency           |
| 5×5 / 7×7   | Capture larger patterns, but more computation and parameters |

---

#### 9. **Example Output Computation**

* Input patch:

  $$
  \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & 2 & 1 \\
  0 & 1 & 0 \\
  2 & 1 & 2
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$
* Filter:

  $$
  \begin{bmatrix}
  0 & 1 & 0 \\
  1 & -4 & 1 \\
  0 & 1 & 0
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$
* Output value at that position = **dot product + bias**

---

#### 10. **Filter Visualization**

* After training, filters can be visualized to interpret **what the network has learned**.
* In early layers, they often resemble **edge detectors**.
* In deeper layers, they represent **shapes or object parts**.

---
### **Common CNN Architectures**

### **ResNet (Residual Network)**

---

#### 1. **Overview**

* **Developed by**: Kaiming He et al., Microsoft Research
* **Year**: 2015
* **Competition**: ILSVRC 2015
* **Achievement**: Won ImageNet 2015 with a **top-5 error rate of 3.57%**

---

#### 2. **Motivation**

* Very deep networks often suffer from **vanishing gradients** and **degradation**: accuracy gets worse as more layers are added.
* ResNet solves this by using **residual (skip) connections** that allow gradients to flow through the network more easily.

---

#### 3. **Key Innovation: Residual Connections**

* Instead of learning a direct mapping $H(x)$, the network learns the **residual** $F(x) = H(x) - x$, so:

$$
H(x) = F(x) + x
$$

* The **input $x$** is added (skipped) directly to the **output** of a few stacked layers.

---

#### 4. **Residual Block (Basic Building Block)**

| Layer | Operation                          |
| ----- | ---------------------------------- |
| 1     | Conv → BatchNorm → ReLU            |
| 2     | Conv → BatchNorm                   |
| Skip  | Add input $x$ to output of layer 2 |
| 3     | ReLU (on the sum)                  |

If input and output shapes differ, a **1×1 convolution** is used in the skip path to match dimensions.

---

| **ResNet-152** | 152    | Used in many advanced models                |

---

#### 6. **Bottleneck Block (Used in ResNet-50 and deeper)**

| Sequence | Description                  |
| -------- | ---------------------------- |
| 1×1 Conv | Reduces dimensions           |
| 3×3 Conv | Processes features           |
| 1×1 Conv | Restores original dimensions |
