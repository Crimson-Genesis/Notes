## 🔍 **What is Machine Learning?**

1. **Definition**:

   * Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that gives computers the ability to **learn from data** without being explicitly programmed.
   * It focuses on developing algorithms that can **identify patterns** and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

2. **Key Idea**:

   * Instead of writing code with fixed rules, we **train models on data**, and the model automatically **finds patterns or relationships** to perform tasks.

3. **Example**:

   * Spam detection in emails: Instead of coding rules like “if the email contains ‘free money’ then spam,” we provide examples of spam and non-spam emails to the model.

* **Cluster Assumption**: Data tend to form clusters; points in the same cluster likely share labels.
* **Manifold Assumption**: Data lies approximately on a lower-dimensional manifold in the high-dimensional space.

---

#### 4. **How It Works**

1. Start with a small labeled dataset.
2. Train an initial model.
3. Use the model to predict labels for the unlabeled data (pseudo-labeling).
4. Combine both labeled and pseudo-labeled data to retrain the model.
5. Iterate to refine the model.

---

#### 5. **Common Techniques**

##### a. **Self-training**

* The model is trained on labeled data, then labels the unlabeled data.
* High-confidence predictions are added to the training set iteratively.

##### b. **Co-training**

* Multiple models are trained on different views (feature subsets) of the data.
* Each model teaches the other by labeling data it is confident about.

##### c. **Transductive Learning**

* Instead of learning a general function, the model focuses on labeling the specific unlabeled data available during training (e.g., graph-based methods).

##### d. **Generative Models**

* Use models like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) or Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to learn representations from both labeled and unlabeled data.

##### e. **Graph-Based Methods**

* Represent data as a graph with edges between similar points.
* Label information is propagated across the graph using algorithms like label propagation.

---

#### 6. **Applications**

* **Text classification** (e.g., sentiment analysis with few labeled reviews)
* **Speech recognition** (transcribing a few samples, using them to train on more)
* **Medical diagnosis** (annotated cases are few, raw scans are plenty)
* **Web content classification**
* **Image recognition** (only a few annotated images per category)

---

#### 7. **Benefits**

* Reduces dependency on large labeled datasets.
* Often achieves performance close to fully supervised models.
* Exploits naturally occurring data distributions.

---

#### 8. **Challenges**

* Incorrect pseudo-labels can propagate errors (confirmation bias).
* Sensitive to model confidence thresholds.
* Not all unlabeled data may be useful — can introduce noise.
* Requires careful validation strategies due to limited labeled data.

---

#### 9. **Evaluation**

* Same metrics as supervised learning (accuracy, F1, RMSE, etc.) but evaluated **only on labeled validation/test sets**.
* Use **cross-validation** and **label-efficiency curves** to measure effectiveness.

---

### **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**

---

#### 1. **Definition**

* Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning where an **agent** learns to make decisions by **interacting with an environment**, aiming to **maximize cumulative reward**.
* Unlike supervised learning, it doesn't learn from labeled data but from **feedback** (rewards or punishments).

---

| **Q-function (Q(s,a))** | Expected return from taking action `a` in state `s` |

---

#### 3. **Objective**

$$

where $R_t$ is the total reward from time step $t$ onward.

---

#### 4. **Types of Feedback**

* **Positive Reward**: Reinforces a good action.

  * Controls the importance of future rewards
  * $\gamma = 0$: short-sighted (only immediate reward)
  * $\gamma → 1$: long-sighted (values future rewards)

---

    Q(s,a) \leftarrow Q(s,a) + \alpha [r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]
    $$
  * Off-policy method

##### b. **Policy-Based Methods**

* Ensures **consistency**, **quality**, and **accuracy** in the input data to improve model performance.

---

#### 2. **Goals**

* Remove noise, handle missing values, and format the data for better learning.
* Convert data into a **standardized and normalized** form.
* Extract meaningful **features** and remove irrelevant ones.

---

#### 3. **Steps in Data Pre-processing**

---

#### 3.1 **Data Cleaning**

* **Handling Missing Values**:

  * Remove rows/columns with missing values.
  * Replace with mean/median/mode (imputation).
  * Use interpolation or model-based prediction.
* **Removing Duplicates**:

  * Eliminate exact copies of rows to avoid biased training.
* **Noise Removal**:

  * Use filtering techniques to smooth data (especially in time series).
* **Outlier Detection**:

  * Use Z-score, IQR, or isolation forests to detect extreme values.

---

#### 3.2 **Data Transformation**

* **Normalization (Min-Max Scaling)**:

  * Scales features to a range \[0,1].

  $$
  x' = \frac{x - x_{min}}{x_{max} - x_{min}}
  $$
* **Standardization (Z-score Scaling)**:

  * Scales features to have mean = 0 and std = 1.

  $$
  x' = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
  $$
* **Log Transformation**:

  * Used for skewed data to reduce range and variance.

---

#### 2. **Steps in Training a Predictive Model**

---

#### 2.1 **Split the Dataset**

* **Training Set**: Used to train the model (typically 60–80% of data).
* **Validation Set**: Used to tune hyperparameters and avoid overfitting.
* **Test Set**: Used to evaluate final model performance on unseen data.

---

#### 2.2 **Model Selection Criteria**

* **Nature of Target Variable**:

  * **Classification** (discrete output): Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, etc.
  * **Regression** (continuous output): Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, etc.

  * Small: Simpler models preferred (e.g., linear, tree-based).
  * Large: Complex models possible (e.g., deep learning).
* **Dimensionality**:

  * High-dimensional: Regularized models or feature selection may be needed.
* **Linearity**:

  * If relationship is linear → linear models.
  * If non-linear → decision trees, kernel-based models, or neural networks.

---

#### 2.3 **Train the Model**

* **Feed input features and corresponding labels** to the model.
* Model uses a **loss function** to measure error between predicted and actual values.
* **Optimization algorithm** (e.g., Gradient Descent) updates model parameters to minimize the loss.
