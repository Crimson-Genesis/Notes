### **1. Introduction**

The **Network Layer (Layer 3)** is responsible for:

* **Routing** packets from source to destination across multiple networks.
* **Addressing**, **packet forwarding**, and **handling congestion**.

The design of the network layer involves several key challenges and decisions.

### **Store-and-Forward Packet Switching**

---

### **1. Definition**

* **Store-and-Forward** is a packet switching technique where each **intermediate router (node)**:

  * **Receives the entire packet**,
  * **Stores it temporarily in memory**,
  * Then **forwards** it to the next hop/router toward the destination.

---

### **2. Working Principle**

| Step | Description                                                            |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Sender breaks data into packets.                                       |
| 2    | Each packet is sent to the first router.                               |
| 3    | Router stores the full packet in its buffer.                           |
| 4    | Router inspects header to determine the next hop.                      |
| 5    | Packet is forwarded to next router; process repeats until destination. |

---

### **3. Key Characteristics**

| Feature                     | Description                                                    |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Full packet reception**   | Entire packet must be received before forwarding.              |
| **Buffering required**      | Routers must have memory to store incoming packets.            |
| **Error checking possible** | Allows CRC checks before forwarding.                           |
| **Reliable but slow**       | Introduces latency due to storage and inspection at each node. |

---

### **4. Advantages**

| Advantage                     | Explanation                                             |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Error control**             | Corrupt packets can be detected and discarded.          |
| **Congestion management**     | Buffers help absorb temporary traffic surges.           |
| **Supports different speeds** | Nodes with different link speeds can still communicate. |
| **Ensures correctness**       | Prevents malformed packets from traveling further.      |

---

### **5. Disadvantages**

| Disadvantage             | Explanation                                             |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **High latency**         | Waiting for full packet reception adds delay.           |
| **Buffer overflow**      | If many packets arrive, router memory may be exhausted. |
| **Increased complexity** | Requires more memory and processing at each router.     |

### **Forward Packet Switching Connection**

---

### **1. Definition**

* **Forwarding** in packet switching refers to the process of **moving packets from one incoming interface to the appropriate outgoing interface** at a router.
* It is a **local operation** done by routers using a **forwarding table (or routing table)**.
* Happens after a packet is **received and stored** (as in store-and-forward switching).

---

### **2. Role in Packet Switching**

| Function             | Description                                                              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Packet switching** | A method of sending data in discrete packets using shared network paths. |
| **Forwarding**       | The router’s task of directing an incoming packet to its next hop.       |
| **Routing**          | Determines the best path for packets; forwarding executes the decision.  |

---

### **3. Forwarding Process Steps**

| Step | Description                                                                |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Router **receives a packet** on an interface.                              |
| 2    | It inspects the **destination IP address** in the packet header.           |
| 3    | Router uses its **forwarding table** to find the best **next-hop router**. |
| 4    | The packet is sent to the **next router** via the selected outgoing port.  |

---

### **4. Forwarding Table**

| Destination Network | Next Hop    | Interface |
| ------------------- | ----------- | --------- |
| 192.168.1.0/24      | 192.168.2.1 | eth0      |
| 10.0.0.0/8          | 10.1.1.1    | eth1      |
| Default (0.0.0.0/0) | 203.0.113.1 | eth2      |

| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **No setup phase**     | Each packet is treated independently.         |
| **Routing per packet** | Each packet may take a different path.        |
| **No fixed path**      | Routers make decisions on a per-packet basis. |
| **Example**            | IP (Internet Protocol).                       |

---

#### **B. Connection-Oriented Packet Switching (Virtual Circuit Networks)**

| Feature                         | Description                                                             |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Setup phase required**        | A path (virtual circuit) is established before data is sent.            |
| **Fixed path for all packets**  | All packets follow the same route.                                      |
| **Simpler per-packet handling** | After setup, routers use virtual circuit ID for forwarding.             |
| **Example**                     | ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode), MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching). |

---

### **6. Forwarding vs Routing**

| Parameter | Forwarding                             | Routing                          |

| Purpose   | Move packet to correct next-hop router | Decide optimal path for packets  |
| Operation | Local to router                        | Global across network topology   |
| Based on  | Forwarding table                       | Routing algorithm                |
| Frequency | Per packet                             | Periodic or event-driven updates |

---

### **7. Algorithms Used for Forwarding Decisions**

### **Routing Algorithms – Optimality Principle**

---

### **1. Definition of Routing**

* **Routing** is the process of **determining the best path** in a network for data to travel from the **source** to the **destination**.
* Routers use **routing algorithms** to build and update **routing tables**.

---

### **2. Optimality Principle (Bellman’s Principle)**

#### **Statement**:

> *If router J lies on the optimal path from router I to router K, then the optimal path from J to K also lies along the same route.*

---

#### **Explanation**:

* A subpath of an optimal path is itself optimal.
* Routing decisions can be **built recursively** from smaller optimal subpaths.
* Forms the basis for many dynamic routing algorithms.

---

### **3. Implications of the Optimality Principle**

| Implication                  | Explanation                                                                            |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Consistent metric values** | All routers must evaluate path costs using the same criteria (e.g., hop count, delay). |
| **Efficient routing tables** | Routers can compute shortest paths using known subpaths.                               |
| **Loop-free paths**          | Ensures no routing loops occur in optimal paths.                                       |

---

### **4. Mathematical Representation**

Let:

* `C(i, j)` = cost from node i to node j
* `P(i → j → k)` = path from i to k via j
* Then:

> If `P(i → k)` is optimal and passes through `j`,
> then `P(j → k)` must also be the optimal path from `j` to `k`.

### **5. Use in Routing Algorithms**

| Algorithm                   | How Optimality Principle is Used                                                             |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**    | Builds shortest paths by extending from the source node, ensuring each extension is optimal. |
| **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**  | Updates shortest path estimates using the optimal subpath property.                          |
| **Link State Routing**      | Each router independently computes the shortest path tree using this principle.              |
| **Distance Vector Routing** | Routers share distance vectors; each node uses the principle to update its routes.           |

---

### **6. Graphical Example**

If the shortest path from A to D is A → B → C → D,
then the path from B to D (B → C → D) is also optimal.

```
A --- B --- C --- D
     ↘     ↗
       E
```

If `A → D` via B and C is optimal, then `B → D` via C must also be optimal.

### **1. Definition**

* **Shortest path routing** is a routing strategy that selects the path between the source and destination that has the **minimum cost**.
* Cost may be based on:

  * **Hop count**
  * **Bandwidth**
  * **Delay**
  * **Reliability**
  * **Monetary cost**

---

### **2. Objective**

To determine the **least-cost path** from a source node to every other node in the network using **graph algorithms**.

---

### **3. Network as a Graph**

* The network is modeled as a **graph G = (V, E)**:

  * **V** = set of routers (vertices)
  * **E** = set of links (edges) between routers
  * Each edge has a **weight** (cost metric)

### **Flooding in Routing**

---

### **1. Definition**

* **Flooding** is a **routing technique** in which every **incoming packet** is **sent out on all outgoing links**, except the one on which it arrived.
* It is a **brute-force, blind forwarding** method used primarily in special scenarios.

---

### **2. Characteristics**

| Feature                     | Description                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Broadcast method**        | Delivers the packet to **every node** in the network.        |
| **No routing table needed** | Routers do **not compute paths** or maintain routing tables. |
| **Simple logic**            | “Forward the packet to all neighbors.”                       |
| **Guaranteed delivery**     | If a path exists, flooding **will reach** the destination.   |

---

### **3. Flooding Process**

1. **Source node** generates a packet.
2. For each **outgoing link**, the router sends a **copy** of the packet.
3. Every **router** that receives the packet does the **same**.
4. Eventually, the packet reaches **all nodes** (including the destination).

---

### **4. Problems with Basic Flooding**

| Problem                | Explanation                                         |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Packet duplication** | Every node sends multiple copies to its neighbors.  |
| **Network congestion** | Massive traffic due to uncontrolled replication.    |
| **Infinite loops**     | Packets may circulate endlessly without control.    |
| **Wasted bandwidth**   | Many packets may reach nodes that do not need them. |

---

### **5. Solutions to Flooding Problems**

---

#### **A. Hop Count / Time To Live (TTL)**

* **Each packet** has a **counter** initialized to a maximum hop value.
* The counter **decrements at each hop**.
* If it reaches **zero**, the packet is **discarded**.

---

#### **B. Sequence Numbering**

* Each packet gets a **unique sequence number**.
* Each router maintains a **record of received sequence numbers**.
* Duplicate packets are **discarded**.

---

#### **C. Selective Flooding**

* Packets are **not sent on all links**.
* Only **some links** (based on direction or topology) are used to reduce redundancy.

---

### **6. Applications of Flooding**

| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Routing discovery**  | Used in some dynamic routing protocols to **discover paths**.    |
| **Broadcasting**       | Sending data to **all nodes** (e.g., ARP request in LANs).       |
| **Multicasting base**  | Forms the base for some multicast strategies.                    |
| **Network robustness** | Ensures delivery even in the presence of **link/node failures**. |

---

### **8. Disadvantages**

| Disadvantage             | Explanation                                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **High overhead**        | Generates exponential number of packets.         |
| **Wastes resources**     | Causes redundant and unnecessary transmissions.  |
| **Loops and congestion** | Without control, may flood network continuously. |

| Use Cases               | ARP, path discovery, emergency messaging            |
| Performance             | Poor in large networks due to overhead              |

---

### **Distance Vector Routing**

---

### **1. Definition**

* **Distance Vector Routing** is a **dynamic routing protocol** where each router maintains a table (called a **distance vector**) that contains the **best known distance to every other router** and the **next hop** to reach them.
* Routers exchange this information periodically with their **direct neighbors**.

---

### **2. Key Concepts**

| Concept                    | Description                                                                                 |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Distance Vector**        | A list of destination networks, the cost (distance) to reach them, and the next-hop router. |
| **Periodic Updates**       | Routers periodically send their entire distance vector to immediate neighbors.              |
| **Bellman-Ford Algorithm** | Used to update routing tables based on neighbors' information.                              |

---

### **3. Distance Vector Table Format**

Each router maintains a table like:

| Destination | Distance (Cost) | Next Hop |
| ----------- | --------------- | -------- |
| A           | 0               | —        |
| B           | 1               | B        |
| C           | 3               | B        |
| D           | 4               | C        |

---

### **4. Working Principle**

1. **Initialization**: Each router sets the distance to itself as **0** and others as **∞**.
2. **Exchange**: Routers send their distance vector to all **direct neighbors**.
3. **Update**: On receiving a neighbor’s vector, router updates its table using:

   ```
   D(A,B) = min [ D(A,C) + D(C,B) ]
   ```

   where A is current router, C is neighbor, B is destination.
4. **Repeat**: Process continues until all routers converge to correct paths.

---

### **5. Routing Table Update Rule (Bellman-Ford Equation)**

For router A, the cost to reach destination D:

```
D_A(D) = min over all neighbors N { cost(A → N) + D_N(D) }
```

---

### **6. Example Scenario**

Network Topology:

```
A ---1--- B ---1--- C
```

* A's initial table:

  * A: 0 (—)
  * B: ∞
  * C: ∞
* After exchanging with B:

  * A learns it can reach B via 1 hop
  * Then learns C via B: 1 (A → B) + 1 (B → C) = 2 hops

| Disadvantage                  | Explanation                                                            |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Slow convergence**          | Updates propagate slowly, causing temporary loops or black holes.      |
| **Count-to-infinity problem** | Incorrect routes propagate endlessly (solved with split horizon, etc.) |
| **Routing loops**             | Can occur if topology changes and routers have outdated information.   |

---

### **9. Solutions to Problems**

| Count-to-infinity | Split horizon, poison reverse, hold-down timers        |
| Loops             | Triggered updates, consistent metric updates           |
| Convergence delay | Triggered updates on changes, smaller update intervals |

---

### **10. Protocols Using Distance Vector**

---

### **Count to Infinity Problem**

---

### **1. Definition**

* The **Count to Infinity (CTI)** problem is a **routing issue in distance vector protocols** where routers take an **excessively long time to converge** on the correct routing information after a **network failure**, especially in **looped topologies**.

---

### **2. Why It Happens**

| Cause                         | Description                                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Distance Vector Updates**   | Routers only know their **neighbors' distances** to destinations.            |
| **No global view**            | Routers don’t know the full path—just the cost reported by neighbors.        |
| **Incorrect assumptions**     | Routers assume if a neighbor says a route exists, it must be valid.          |
| **Failure propagation delay** | Network changes (like link failures) take time to propagate through routers. |

---

### **3. Typical Scenario**

Given topology:

```
A --- B --- C
```

* Initial Routing Tables:

  * A: to C = 2 (via B)
  * B: to C = 1 (direct)
  * C: to C = 0

#### Now, link **B—C** fails:

1. B cannot reach C directly.
2. A tells B: “I can reach C in 2 hops.”
3. B **believes A**, updates: C = 3 (via A)
4. A then hears from B: “C is 3 hops away”, so A updates: C = 4
5. This continues: C = 5, 6, 7, ..., ∞ (counting to infinity)

---

### **4. Symptoms**

| Symptom               | Explanation                                                |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Rising hop counts** | Hop counts increment gradually instead of being corrected. |
| **Routing loops**     | Packets may circulate between routers indefinitely.        |
| **Slow convergence**  | Network takes a long time to recognize unreachable nodes.  |

---

### **5. Infinity Definition**

* To avoid endless counting, a maximum hop limit is defined.
* In **RIP**, infinity is **16 hops**.
* If cost > 15, the destination is considered **unreachable**.

| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Basic rule**     | A router **does not advertise a route** back on the interface from which it was learned. |
| **Prevents loops** | Stops routers from believing incorrect reverse routes.                                   |

---

#### **2. Split Horizon with Poison Reverse**

| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Delay update**    | After detecting route failure, router **waits** before accepting alternate routes. |

| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Immediate update**   | Router **sends update instantly** on change, not waiting for periodic interval. |
| **Faster convergence** | Helps notify neighbors quickly about broken paths.                              |

| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fixed limit**              | Consider destination unreachable after N hops (e.g., 16 in RIP). |

| Occurs In       | Distance Vector Routing (e.g., RIP)                         |
| Problem         | Incorrect routing info slowly propagates and loops          |

### **8. Visualization**

```
Initial:
B → C = 1
A → C = 2 via B

Link B—C fails:
B → C = ∞
A says: “I reach C in 2”
B updates: C = 3
A hears: C = 3 → updates to 4
→ C = 5, 6, 7, ... ∞
```

### **Link State Routing**

---

### **1. Definition**

* **Link State Routing** is a **dynamic routing algorithm** in which each router:

  * Builds a **complete map** of the network topology.
  * Uses **Dijkstra’s algorithm** to compute **shortest paths** to all destinations.
* Used in **link-state protocols** like **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)** and **IS-IS**.

---

### **2. Key Characteristics**

| Feature                            | Description                                                              |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Topology knowledge**             | Each router knows the full network topology.                             |
| **Link state advertisement (LSA)** | Routers broadcast information about their direct links to all routers.   |
| **Reliable flooding**              | LSAs are sent to all routers using flooding (not same as data flooding). |
| **Shortest path calculation**      | Routers use **Dijkstra’s algorithm** to find best paths.                 |
| **Fast convergence**               | More responsive to topology changes than distance vector.                |

---

### **3. Steps in Link State Routing**

---

#### **Step 1: Neighbor Discovery**

* Router identifies its **directly connected neighbors** using a **Hello protocol**.

---

#### **Step 2: Measuring Link Costs**

* Each router determines the **cost (metric)** of the link to each neighbor.
* Metrics may include:

  * Bandwidth
  * Delay
  * Hop count
  * Load

---

#### **Step 3: Creating Link State Packets (LSPs)**

* Each router builds a **Link State Packet (LSP)** containing:

  * Router ID
  * List of neighbors and cost to each
  * Sequence number
  * Time to live (TTL)

---

#### **Step 4: Flooding of LSPs**

* Each router **floods** its LSP to **all other routers** in the network.
* Routers use **sequence numbers** and **TTL** to prevent loops and duplication.

---

#### **Step 5: Building Link State Database (LSDB)**

* Routers store all received LSPs in a **Link State Database**.
* This database represents the **entire network topology**.

---

#### **Step 6: Route Calculation**

* Each router runs **Dijkstra’s algorithm** on the LSDB to:

  * Compute **shortest path tree (SPT)** rooted at itself.
  * Populate the **routing table** with the next hop for each destination.

---

### **4. Example**

Let’s say a network of 4 routers:

```
A ---1--- B
|         |
4         2
|         |
C ---3--- D
```

* Each router shares its link states.
* All routers now have the **same view** of the network graph.
* Each router runs **Dijkstra’s algorithm** to compute shortest paths.

| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **More memory required**      | Routers must store full topology (LSDB).                               |
| **More CPU usage**            | Dijkstra’s algorithm is computation-intensive.                         |
| **Complex implementation**    | More difficult to configure and maintain.                              |
| **Initial flooding overhead** | LSP flooding can use high bandwidth during startup or topology change. |

---

### **8. Protocols Using Link State Routing**

---

### **9. Summary Table**

| Parameter          | Link State Routing               |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- |

---

### **Path Vector Routing**

---

### **1. Definition**

* **Path Vector Routing** is a type of **routing protocol** in which each router maintains the **entire path (a sequence of AS numbers or routers)** to each destination.
* It is mainly used in **inter-domain routing**, such as on the Internet between different **Autonomous Systems (AS)**.

---

### **2. Key Characteristics**

| Feature                  | Description                                                                      |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Entire path known**    | Each route includes the full path to the destination (e.g., list of AS numbers). |
| **Loop prevention**      | Loops are avoided by **checking for repeated entries** in the path.              |
| **Policy-based routing** | Allows decisions based on administrative policies, not just metrics.             |
| **Decentralized**        | Routers in each AS choose their own policies and preferences.                    |

---

### **3. Difference from Other Routing Algorithms**

| Routing Type    | Information Exchanged            | Loop Prevention Technique      |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Distance Vector | Distance to destination (cost)   | Split horizon, poison reverse  |
| Link State      | Complete network topology        | Global path computation        |
| **Path Vector** | Distance + actual path (AS path) | Check if own AS/router in path |

---

### **4. How It Works**

1. **Each router or AS** advertises **routes it knows**, including the **path it used** to reach each destination.
2. **Receiving routers** check:

   * If their **own AS** is already in the path → **loop detected** → discard.
   * Otherwise, **add their own AS ID** and forward.
3. Routing decisions can be made using:

   * **Path length**
   * **Routing policy**
   * **Trust level**

---

### **5. Example**

Assume three Autonomous Systems: AS1, AS2, AS3

```
AS1 ---- AS2 ---- AS3
```

* AS3 advertises: "I can reach Network X via \[AS3]"
* AS2 receives and advertises: "I can reach Network X via \[AS2, AS3]"
* AS1 receives and advertises: "I can reach Network X via \[AS1, AS2, AS3]"

If AS3 later receives a path to X via \[AS3, AS1, AS2, AS3], it **detects a loop** and rejects it.

---

### **6. Loop Avoidance**

* Each router checks the **entire path** in the route advertisement.
* If its **own ID/AS number** appears in the path, it **discards the route**.
* This prevents the formation of **routing loops**.

---

### **7. Common Protocols Using Path Vector**

| Protocol                          | Description                                                              |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **BGP** (Border Gateway Protocol) | Most well-known path vector protocol, used in Internet backbone routing. |

---

### **8. Advantages**

| Advantage                | Description                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Loop-free routing**    | Full path knowledge enables easy detection of loops.          |
| **Policy-based routing** | Supports control over routing based on business or trust.     |
| **Scalability**          | Handles thousands of networks or ASes (used on global scale). |

---

### **9. Disadvantages**

| Disadvantage         | Description                                         |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Complexity**       | More complex than distance-vector protocols.        |
| **Larger updates**   | Path data increases size of routing advertisements. |
| **Slow convergence** | Especially during rapid topology changes.           |

---

### **10. Summary Table**

| Parameter          | Path Vector Routing                     |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Information Shared | Destination + full path (vector of IDs) |
| Loop Prevention    | Check for own ID/AS in path             |
| Routing Basis      | Policies + path attributes              |
| Example Protocol   | BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)           |
| Used In            | Inter-domain routing (between ASes)     |
| Convergence Speed  | Moderate to slow                        |
| Scalability        | Very high                               |
| Flexibility        | Supports complex policy-based decisions |

---

### **Hierarchical Routing**

---

### **1. Definition**

* **Hierarchical Routing** is a routing technique where the **network is divided into multiple layers or regions**, and **routing decisions** are made at different levels of the hierarchy.
* It is designed to **improve scalability and manageability** in large networks by **reducing routing table size and control overhead**.

---

### **2. Key Concepts**

| Concept                  | Description                                                      |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hierarchy**            | Network is divided into regions, domains, or levels.             |
| **Abstraction**          | Lower-level details are hidden from higher levels.               |
| **Routing Separation**   | Intra-region and inter-region routing are handled independently. |
| **Aggregated Addresses** | Summarized address information is used across regions.           |

---

### **3. Structure of Hierarchical Routing**

Example: 3-level structure

```
Level 0: Local Routers (within subnets)
Level 1: Regional Routers (within domains)
Level 2: Backbone Routers (across domains)
```

---

### **4. Types of Hierarchical Routing**

| Type                      | Description                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Two-Level Hierarchy**   | Simple division into domains and backbone (used in OSPF).                   |
| **Multi-Level Hierarchy** | Large ISPs or enterprises with many nested regions or administrative areas. |

---

### **5. Routing Process**

#### **A. Intra-Domain Routing**

* Routing within a region/domain.
* Typically uses **simple protocols** like **RIP, OSPF, or EIGRP**.
* Routers maintain **detailed info** about local nodes.

#### **B. Inter-Domain Routing**

* Routing between regions/domains.
* Uses **path aggregation** (e.g., BGP).
* Routers maintain **abstracted routes** to other domains, not detailed paths.

---

### **6. Example Scenario**

```
Internet
   |
  ISP Backbone (Level 2)
  |       |
Region A  Region B (Level 1)
 |   |      |   |
R1  R2     R3  R4 (Level 0)
```

* R1 and R2 exchange full local routes.
* Region A sends only a **summary route** to Region B.
* Region B uses the summary to forward traffic, without knowing internal layout of Region A.

---

### **7. Advantages**

| Advantage                      | Description                                                       |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scalability**                | Supports large networks by dividing routing responsibilities.     |
| **Reduced Routing Table Size** | Routers store only relevant information (local or aggregated).    |
| **Improved Efficiency**        | Less overhead due to localized updates.                           |
| **Isolation**                  | Faults or changes in one region do not affect others immediately. |

---

### **8. Disadvantages**

| Disadvantage                | Description                                                    |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Complex Configuration**   | Requires careful planning of address allocation and hierarchy. |
| **Suboptimal Routing**      | Abstracted information may cause longer paths than necessary.  |
| **Increased Initial Setup** | Must define and manage levels, domains, and summarization.     |

---

### **Congestion Control Algorithms in the Network Layer (in the Internet)**

---

### **1. Definition of Congestion**

* **Congestion** occurs in a network when the **demand for resources** (like bandwidth, buffers, or processing) **exceeds the available capacity**.
* Leads to:

  * **Packet loss**
  * **Increased delays**
  * **Throughput degradation**

---

### **2. Congestion Control vs Flow Control**

| Aspect      | Congestion Control                         | Flow Control                         |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| **Purpose** | Prevent overloading the **network**        | Prevent overloading the **receiver** |
| **Layer**   | Network Layer (also assisted by Transport) | Transport Layer                      |
| **Scope**   | End-to-end network resource usage          | Sender-receiver rate matching        |

---

### **3. Causes of Congestion**

* **High traffic load**
* **Limited bandwidth**
* **Small router buffers**
* **Burst transmissions**
* **Inefficient routing**

---

### **4. Congestion Control Approaches**

#### **A. Open-Loop Control**

* Prevention-based.
* Decisions made **before congestion occurs**.

#### **B. Closed-Loop Control**

* Reaction-based.
* Monitors system and **responds dynamically** to congestion.

---

### **5. Congestion Control Mechanisms at the Network Layer**

---

### **1. Admission Control**

* **Restricts entry** of new traffic flows if the network is congested.
* Applied in networks requiring **QoS guarantees**.
* Common in **ATM, MPLS, VoIP**.

---

### **2. Traffic Shaping**

* **Smooths traffic flow** to reduce bursts that cause congestion.
* Two common algorithms:

| Algorithm        | Description                                                                            |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Leaky Bucket** | Transmits data at a fixed rate; buffers excess packets.                                |
| **Token Bucket** | Tokens generated at fixed rate; packets need tokens to be sent. Allows bursty traffic. |

---

### **3. Packet Discarding (Random Early Detection - RED)**

* **Probabilistically drops packets** before buffer becomes full.
* Early indication to sources to **slow down**.
* Avoids global synchronization of flows.
* Helps maintain high throughput and low delay.

---

### **4. Load Shedding**

* **Drops excess packets** when buffer is full (e.g., **tail drop**).
* Simple but can lead to unfair treatment and global synchronization.
* Used when congestion is **severe** and other methods fail.

---

### **5. Resource Reservation**

* Uses protocols like **RSVP (Resource Reservation Protocol)**.
* Allocates bandwidth and buffer space before data transmission.
* Suitable for applications needing **guaranteed QoS**.

---

### **6. Routing Adjustments**

* Dynamic routing algorithms can avoid congested areas.
* Uses **load-sensitive metrics** (e.g., link utilization, delay).
* Shifts traffic to **underutilized paths**.

---

### **6. Congestion Control in the Internet**

* The Internet’s **best-effort model** relies mostly on **transport layer** (TCP) for congestion control.
* **Routers** play a **limited role** (e.g., RED, drop-tail).
* Primary responsibility: **detect and signal congestion**.

---

### **7. Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)**

* Routers **mark packets** instead of dropping when congestion occurs.
* Requires support from:

  * **Routers**
  * **Senders and receivers** (end-to-end)
* TCP responds by **reducing transmission rate**.

---

### **8. Congestion Indicators**

| Indicator            | Description                                    |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Queue Length**     | Long queues → potential congestion             |
| **Packet Loss**      | Dropped packets indicate congestion            |
| **Delay**            | Increased latency suggests buffers are filling |
| **Explicit signals** | ECN marks or congestion flags from routers     |

---

### **9. Summary Table of Network-Layer Congestion Control Techniques**

| Method               | Type        | Description                                            |
| -------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Admission Control    | Open-loop   | Limits new flows during high load                      |
| Traffic Shaping      | Open-loop   | Controls rate and burstiness (leaky/token bucket)      |
| RED                  | Closed-loop | Drops packets early based on average queue length      |
| Load Shedding        | Closed-loop | Discards packets when buffers are full                 |
| Resource Reservation | Open-loop   | Reserves bandwidth/resources using RSVP                |
| Dynamic Routing      | Closed-loop | Avoids congested paths                                 |
| ECN                  | Closed-loop | Marks instead of dropping packets to inform congestion |

---

### **10. Conclusion**

* Congestion control at the network layer helps maintain **network performance**, **packet delivery**, and **fairness**.
* The Internet relies on **a combination of simple router mechanisms** and **smart end-host protocols** (like TCP).
* Advanced methods like **RED**, **ECN**, and **resource reservation** are critical in **modern scalable networks**.

* QoS ensures that **network resources (bandwidth, buffer, CPU)** are **allocated and managed** to meet specific **service requirements** like:

  * **Latency**
  * **Jitter**
  * **Bandwidth**
  * **Packet loss**
