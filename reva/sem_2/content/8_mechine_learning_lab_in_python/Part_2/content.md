# Part B -> 
1. Write a program to demonstrate the working of the decision tree based ID3 algorithm, Use and appropriate data set for building the decision tree and apply this knowledge to classify a new sample.
2. Build an artificial neural network by implementing the backpropagation algorithm and test the same using appropriate data sets.
3. Write a program to implement the naive Bayesian classifier for a sample training data set stored as a .CSV file. Computr the accuracy of the classifier, considering few test data set.
4. Write a program to demonstrate reinforcement learning.
5. Write a program to implement CNN models for classification of images.
