# Course Content
## Part A -> 
1. Write a program to implement how to read and display a dataset in python.
2. Write a program to learn how to select features for machine learning.
3. Write the program to implement Data Pre-processing for machine learning.
4. Write a program to implement classification algorithm, Calculate the accuracy, precision, recall.
5. Write a program to demonstrate SVM with different kernel methods.
6. Comparison of machine learning techniques.
7. Write a program to create the clustering model.
8. Write a program to create two clustering models on the same daraset. Compare the results of these two algorithms and comment on the quality of clusering.

## Part B -> 
1. Write a program to demonstrate the working of the decision tree based ID3 algorithm, Use and appropriate data set for building the decision tree and apply this knowledge to classify a new sample.
2. Build an artificial neural network by implementing the backpropagation algorithm and test the same using appropriate data sets.
3. Write a program to implement the naive Bayesian classifier for a sample training data set stored as a .CSV file. Computr the accuracy of the classifier, considering few test data set.
4. Write a program to demonstrate reinforcement learning.
5. Write a program to implement CNN models for classification of images.
