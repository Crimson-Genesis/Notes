| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**                | A specific method of gathering information by directly watching and recording events or behaviors as they occur.      | A broader process of systematically gathering information or evidence relevant to research using various methods. |
| **Scope**                     | Narrower; focuses on direct sensory experience, usually visual or auditory.                                           | Broader; includes all methods like observation, surveys, interviews, experiments, and secondary sources.          |
| **Method**                    | Passive or active watching without interference (can be structured or unstructured).                                  | Encompasses multiple methods such as observation, questionnaires, interviews, document review, etc.               |
| **Data Type**                 | Typically qualitative (behavioral, descriptive), can be quantitative if counting events.                              | Can be qualitative or quantitative depending on the method used.                                                  |
| **Role**                      | One of the data collection techniques used within the larger data collection process.                                 | The entire process of gathering data for analysis in research.                                                    |
| **Control Over Environment**  | Often natural or controlled setting, but researcher does not manipulate variables (except in controlled observation). | Depends on the method; can involve manipulation (experiments) or passive gathering (secondary data).              |
| **Interaction with Subjects** | Usually non-intrusive; in non-participant observation, no interaction occurs.                                         | Can be intrusive (interviews) or non-intrusive (observation).                                                     |
| **Example**                   | Watching customer behavior in a store.                                                                                | Collecting survey responses, reviewing archives, conducting experiments.                                          |

| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Null Hypothesis (H0)**              | The default assumption that there is **no effect or difference**.         |
| **Alternative Hypothesis (H1 or Ha)** | The hypothesis that there **is an effect or difference**.                 |
| **Significance Level (α)**            | The probability threshold for rejecting H0, commonly set at 0.05 (5%).    |
| **Test Statistic**                    | A calculated value from the sample data used to decide on H0.             |
| **P-value**                           | Probability of observing the test result, or more extreme, if H0 is true. |
| **Type I Error**                      | Incorrectly rejecting H0 when it is true (false positive).                |
| **Type II Error**                     | Failing to reject H0 when it is false (false negative).                   |

---

### **4. Steps in Hypothesis Testing**
