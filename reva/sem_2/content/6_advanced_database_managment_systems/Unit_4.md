### System Architecture — Detailed Explanation

---

#### 1. **Definition**

* **System architecture** in the context of databases refers to the **design and structure** of how data is stored, managed, accessed, and processed across **single or multiple systems**.
* It includes both **hardware-level** and **software-level** arrangements for supporting data operations efficiently.

---

### 2. **Main Categories of Database System Architecture**

---

#### A) **Centralized Database Architecture**

| Feature                    | Description                                                |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Single-site architecture   | All data stored and processed at **one central location**. |
| Clients access via network | Users send requests through network to centralized DBMS.   |
| Simpler design             | Easy to implement and manage.                              |
| Limitation                 | **Single point of failure**, **scalability issues**.       |

---

#### B) **Distributed Database Architecture**

| Feature                  | Description                                                          |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Multiple sites           | Data is stored across **multiple physical locations** (nodes/sites). |
| Appears as single system | Users interact as if it’s **one database**.                          |
| Local autonomy           | Each site may manage its own operations independently.               |
| Fault tolerance          | Failure at one site doesn't stop the entire system.                  |

**Types**:

* **Homogeneous DDBMS**: All sites use same DBMS software and schema.
* **Heterogeneous DDBMS**: Different sites may use different DBMS or data models.

| **7. Transparency**        | Generally does **not require location, fragmentation, or replication transparency**                 | Requires **location, replication, fragmentation, and concurrency transparency**                         |
| **8. Query Processing**    | Queries are **decomposed and executed in parallel** across processors                               | Queries are **distributed and executed across multiple databases** using global optimization            |

| Type                             | Description                                               |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Horizontal Fragmentation**     | Each fragment is a **subset of rows** (tuples)            |
| **Vertical Fragmentation**       | Each fragment is a **subset of columns** (attributes)     |
| **Mixed (Hybrid) Fragmentation** | Combination of both horizontal and vertical fragmentation |

##### Example:

Table: `EMPLOYEE(EmpID, Name, Dept, Salary)`

* **Horizontal**: Employees in Dept A stored at Site 1, Dept B at Site 2.
* **Vertical**: `EmpID` and `Name` at Site 1, `Dept` and `Salary` at Site 2.

---

#### B) **Data Replication**

Storing **copies of the same data** at **multiple sites** to increase **availability** and **fault tolerance**.

##### Types:

| Type                    | Description                                |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Full Replication**    | Entire database is replicated at all sites |
| **Partial Replication** | Some fragments are replicated selectively  |
| **No Replication**      | Each data fragment exists at only one site |

##### Pros:

* **High availability** and **read performance**
* **Backup in case of site failure**

##### Cons:

* **High storage overhead**
* **Complex update synchronization**

---

#### C) **Data Allocation**

Determining **where to place fragments or replicas** across the distributed system.

##### Strategies:

| Strategy                   | Description                              |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Centralized Allocation** | All data is stored at a single site      |

### 4. **Storage Techniques and Models**

| Technique                       | Description                                                          |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Shared-Nothing Architecture** | Each node has its own private storage and memory                     |
| **Shared-Disk Architecture**    | All nodes access a **common disk** (requires locking & coordination) |
| **Cloud-Based Storage**         | Data is stored using **cloud services** like AWS S3, GCP, etc.       |
| **Object Storage Systems**      | Stores data as objects with metadata (e.g., Amazon S3, Ceph)         |
| **Distributed File Systems**    | Stores data in blocks (e.g., HDFS, GlusterFS) across multiple nodes  |

---

### 5. **Metadata Management**

Stores **information about data fragments**, such as:

* **Location of fragments**
* **Replication status**
* **Access permissions**
* **Fragmentation schema**

A **global directory** or **catalog manager** keeps track of where and how data is stored.

---

### 6. **Example Scenario**

Suppose a retail company has branches in Delhi, Mumbai, and Bangalore:

* **Horizontal Fragmentation**: Sales data for each region is stored locally.
* **Replication**: Inventory data is replicated at all locations.
* **Allocation**: Customer data stored in Bangalore, replicated to Mumbai.

### Data Fragmentation in Distributed Databases — Detailed Explanation

---

#### 1. **Definition**

**Data Fragmentation** is the process of **dividing a database relation (table)** into **smaller pieces (fragments)** which can be stored at different sites in a distributed database system.

* Fragmentation improves **performance**, **locality**, **concurrency**, and **availability**.
* It ensures that **each piece of data is stored where it is most frequently accessed**.

---

#### 2. **Goals of Fragmentation**

| Goal                       | Description                                                             |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Efficiency**             | Reduce data transfer by storing data near the site where it’s most used |
| **Parallelism**            | Allow parallel query execution on different fragments                   |
| **Local Autonomy**         | Enable each site to process local queries independently                 |
| **Scalability**            | Distribute storage load across sites                                    |
| **Improved Response Time** | Minimize network latency and query time                                 |

---

#### 3. **Types of Fragmentation**

---

### A) **Horizontal Fragmentation**

* **Divides a relation into subsets of rows** (tuples).
* Each fragment is a selection (σ) of the original relation based on some predicate.

#### Example:

Relation: `EMP(EmpID, Name, Dept, Salary)`

Fragment 1:

```sql
σ Dept = 'Sales' (EMP)
```

Fragment 2:

```sql
σ Dept = 'HR' (EMP)
```

| Advantages                            | Notes                             |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| - Supports **data locality**          | - Good for **site-specific data** |
| - Facilitates **parallel processing** | - No duplication of attributes    |

---

### B) **Vertical Fragmentation**

* **Divides a relation into subsets of columns** (attributes).
* Each fragment must include a **primary key** to allow reconstruction via a **natural join**.

#### Example:

Relation: `EMP(EmpID, Name, Dept, Salary)`

Fragment 1:

```text
(EmpID, Name)
```

Fragment 2:

```text
(EmpID, Dept, Salary)
```

| Advantages                              | Notes                                         |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| - Keeps **related attributes together** | - Better for **attribute-specific** queries   |
| - Reduces I/O for partial column access | - Requires **join** to reconstruct full table |

---

### C) **Mixed (Hybrid) Fragmentation**

* Combination of both **horizontal and vertical fragmentation**.
* Useful when neither pure horizontal nor pure vertical fragmentation is sufficient.

#### Example:

1. First **horizontally fragment** based on `Dept`.
2. Then **vertically fragment** each result based on column groupings.

| Advantage       | Notes                                    |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| - Very flexible | - More complex to manage and reconstruct |

---

### 4. **Derived (Derived or Derived Horizontal) Fragmentation**

* A relation is **fragmented based on another relation's fragmentation**.
* Used to maintain **referential integrity** in related tables.

#### Example:

* `DEPARTMENT` is fragmented horizontally by `Location`.
* `EMPLOYEE` is **derived fragmented** based on `DepartmentID` from `DEPARTMENT`.

---

### 5. **Correctness Criteria for Fragmentation**

To ensure data remains usable after fragmentation:

| Criteria               | Meaning                                                                               |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Completeness**       | All data from the original relation must be in the fragments                          |
| **Reconstructability** | The original relation can be rebuilt by **union (horizontal)** or **join (vertical)** |
| **Disjointness**       | No overlapping data (only for horizontal fragmentation unless explicitly allowed)     |

---

### 6. **Fragmentation Schema Example**

Given table:
`STUDENT(SID, Name, Program, CGPA, City)`

#### Horizontal Fragmentation by City:

* F1 = Students from **Delhi**
* F2 = Students from **Mumbai**
* F3 = Students from **Other cities**

#### Vertical Fragmentation:

* F1 = (SID, Name, Program)
* F2 = (SID, CGPA, City)

---

### 7. **Advantages of Fragmentation**

| Advantage                        | Description                                         |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ **Improved query performance** | Queries access smaller, relevant data chunks        |
| ✅ **Reduced data transfer**      | Data stays close to where it's needed               |
| ✅ **Parallelism**                | Multiple sites can process fragments simultaneously |
| ✅ **Scalability**                | Distributes load across sites                       |
| ✅ **Local autonomy**             | Each site can manage its own data                   |

---

### 8. **Disadvantages of Fragmentation**

| Disadvantage                        | Description                                                |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| ❌ **Complexity**                    | Requires metadata for managing fragmentation               |
| ❌ **Reconstruction Overhead**       | Joining fragments to recreate original relations is costly |
| ❌ **Update Synchronization**        | Difficult to maintain consistency across fragments         |
| ❌ **Query Optimization Difficulty** | Optimizer must handle fragmentation-aware planning         |

---

### 9. **Reconstruction Operations**

| Fragmentation Type | Reconstruction Method               |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Horizontal         | **UNION (∪)** of all fragments      |
| Vertical           | **NATURAL JOIN (⨝)** on primary key |
| Hybrid             | Combination of above                |

---

### 10. **Conclusion**

Data fragmentation is essential in distributed databases to:

* Enable **efficient distributed query processing**
* Support **data distribution and locality**
* Enhance **fault tolerance and system scalability**

Choosing the right fragmentation strategy (horizontal, vertical, or hybrid) depends on **data access patterns**, **query types**, and **system architecture**.

| **Failure Tolerance**                | Poor — no duplicate                                     | Good — other replicas serve if one fails                          | Depends on replication & site availability                  |
| **Reconstruction Requirement**       | YES — needs joins or unions to recreate full data       | NO — same data available in multiple locations                    | NO — allocation only controls placement, not data structure |
| **Common Usage**                     | Local access optimization                               | High availability systems, read-intensive apps                    | Geographic and usage-based optimization                     |
| **Relationship with Other Concepts** | Can be combined with replication and allocation         | Often based on fragments; needs allocation to determine placement | Needs fragmentation and/or replication to operate on        |

### **Query Processing in Distributed Databases – Detailed Explanation**

---

### 🔷 1. **Definition**

**Query processing** is the set of steps taken by a **database management system (DBMS)** to **translate, optimize, and execute** a high-level query (typically in SQL) into a series of **low-level operations** that can be carried out efficiently by the database engine.

In **distributed databases**, query processing is more complex due to:

* Data being stored across **multiple sites**
* **Network communication** cost
* **Different site capabilities** and **data locations**

---

### 🔷 2. **Phases of Query Processing**

---

#### ✅ A) **Parsing and Translation**

* SQL query is **parsed** to verify **syntax** and **semantics**
* Translated into **relational algebra** or **query tree**

#### ✅ B) **Query Optimization**

* Multiple **logical and physical plans** are considered
* Chooses **most efficient plan** based on **cost estimates** (I/O, CPU, network)

#### ✅ C) **Query Decomposition (in distributed DB)**

* Global query is **broken into subqueries**
* Each subquery is mapped to relevant site(s) for execution

#### ✅ D) **Data Localization**

* Identify **which sites hold the needed data fragments**
* Account for **replicated data** and **fragmentation**

#### ✅ E) **Plan Generation**

* Convert logical query into an **execution plan** (physical operators)
* Determine **access methods**, **join algorithms**, **pipelining**

#### ✅ F) **Code Generation and Execution**

* Translate the physical plan into **site-specific code**
* Distribute and execute the plan at relevant sites

### 🔷 8. **Example: Join Ordering Impact**

Relations: A (10K rows), B (100 rows), C (5 rows)

Join Order 1:

```
(A ⋈ B) ⋈ C → Intermediate result is large
```

Join Order 2:

```
(B ⋈ C) ⋈ A → Intermediate result is small → better
```
