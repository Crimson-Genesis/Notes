### Storage in ADBMS (Advanced Database Management Systems)

#### 1. **Overview of Physical Storage Media**

* **Primary Storage:** Typically refers to main memory (RAM), volatile and fast but limited in size.
* **Secondary Storage:** Non-volatile storage devices like hard disks, SSDs, tapes.
* **Tertiary Storage:** Used for archival, e.g., optical disks, magnetic tapes, slower but cheaper and larger capacity.
* **Characteristics:**

  * **Access Time:** Time to access a particular data unit.
  * **Transfer Rate:** Speed of data transfer.
  * **Capacity:** Amount of data stored.
  * **Volatility:** Whether data is lost on power off (volatile vs non-volatile).

#### 2. **Magnetic Disk Storage**

* **Physical Structure:**

  * Composed of platters coated with magnetic material.
  * Platters spin at constant speed (measured in RPM).
  * Each platter has concentric tracks.
  * Each track divided into sectors (smallest physical storage unit).
  * Read/write head moves radially to access tracks (seek time).
* **Disk Performance Metrics:**

  * **Seek Time:** Time to move the head to the desired track.
  * **Rotational Latency:** Waiting time for the sector to rotate under the head.
  * **Transfer Time:** Time to transfer data once head is positioned.
* **Block Concept:**

  * Disk blocks or pages are units of data transfer.
  * Block size affects performance and storage efficiency.

#### 3. **Buffering of Blocks**

* **Buffering:** Temporary storage in main memory for disk blocks.
* **Purpose:**

  * Reduce disk I/O by caching frequently used blocks.
  * Improve system performance.
* **Buffer Management:**

  * Policies like LRU (Least Recently Used), MRU (Most Recently Used) used for replacement.
  * Pinning buffers to prevent eviction during I/O operations.

#### 4. **Placing of File Records on Disk**

* **File Records:** Logical units of data stored inside blocks.
* **Placement Strategies:**

  * **Contiguous Allocation:** Records stored in consecutive blocks; fast sequential access but difficult to grow.
  * **Linked Allocation:** Blocks linked via pointers; easy to grow but slower sequential access.
  * **Indexed Allocation:** Uses an index block to point to all file blocks; allows random access efficiently.
* **Record Blocking:**

  * Multiple records packed into one block for efficient use of disk space.
  * Fixed-length vs variable-length records affect placement complexity.

#### 5. **RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks)**

* **Purpose:** To improve reliability, availability, and performance of storage.
* **Levels:**

  * **RAID 0 (Striping):** Data split across disks for speed, no redundancy.
  * **RAID 1 (Mirroring):** Data copied identically on two disks for fault tolerance.
  * **RAID 2 to 6:** Use various parity and error correction schemes (e.g., RAID 5 uses block-level striping with distributed parity).
* **Benefits:**

  * Fault tolerance.
  * Increased throughput by parallelizing disk accesses.
* **Trade-offs:**

  * Cost (extra disks for redundancy).
  * Complexity in controller and management.

### File Structure in ADBMS

#### 1. **Definition**

* A **file structure** refers to the way records are stored, organized, and accessed in a file on secondary storage.
* It determines how efficiently data can be retrieved, inserted, updated, and deleted.

#### 2. **Components of File Structure**

* **Records:** The basic units of data stored (e.g., rows in a table).
* **Fields:** Components of a record (attributes or columns).
* **File:** A collection of records.
* **Blocks (Pages):** Physical units of storage on disk, containing one or more records.
* **File Header:** Metadata about the file such as number of records, record size, pointers to blocks, etc.

#### 3. **Types of File Structures**

* **Heap File (Unordered File):**

  * Records are placed arbitrarily, in the order they are inserted.
  * No particular order maintained.
  * Efficient for bulk loading.
  * Access requires full file scan (linear search).
* **Sorted File:**

  * Records sorted by a key field.
  * Enables binary search for faster retrieval.
  * Insertion and deletion require shifting records or reorganization.
  * Efficient for range queries.
* **Hashed File:**

  * Records stored based on a hash function applied on key fields.
  * Enables direct access to records using key.
  * Efficient for equality queries.
  * Collisions handled by overflow chains or open addressing.

#### 4. **File Structure Operations**

* **Insertion:** Add a new record.

  * Heap: append at the end.
  * Sorted: find position and shift records.
  * Hashed: compute hash, place in bucket or overflow.
* **Deletion:** Remove a record.

  * May involve marking deleted or physically removing.
* **Search/Retrieval:**

  * Heap: linear scan.
  * Sorted: binary search.
  * Hashed: direct access by hash.
* **Update:** Modify a record in place or via delete+insert.

#### 5. **Physical Organization Implications**

* Access speed, storage utilization, and maintenance overhead depend on file structure.
* Choice influenced by:

  * Types of queries (e.g., equality vs range).
  * Frequency of insertions/deletions.
  * Available storage and memory.

#### 6. **File Structure Metadata**

* Information about:

  * Record length.
  * Number of records.
  * Pointers to blocks or extents.
  * Index pointers if any.

### Magnetic Disk (Detailed Explanation - T2 Level)

#### 1. **Structure of Magnetic Disk**

* Composed of one or more rigid circular platters.
* Platters coated with magnetic material for data storage.
* Platters mounted on a spindle that spins at constant speed (commonly 5,400 to 15,000 RPM).
* Each platter has two surfaces, each accessed by a read/write head.
* Heads are mounted on an arm that moves radially to access different tracks.

#### 2. **Logical Organization**

* **Tracks:** Concentric circles on the platter surface where data is recorded.
* **Sectors:** Each track is divided into sectors, smallest addressable unit on the disk (commonly 512 bytes or 4 KB).
* **Cylinders:** Set of tracks located at the same position on all platters (i.e., all tracks accessible without moving the head assembly).

#### 3. **Disk Operations and Performance Parameters**

* **Seek Time:** Time to move the head arm to the track containing the desired data.

  * Depends on distance between current and target track.
  * Typical average seek time: 3-15 ms.
* **Rotational Latency:** Waiting time for the platter to rotate so that the desired sector is under the head.

  * Average latency is half the time of one full rotation.
  * For a 7200 RPM disk, one rotation takes 8.33 ms, so average latency \~4.17 ms.
* **Transfer Time:** Time to read/write the data once the head is positioned over the sector.

  * Depends on data rate and block size.

#### 4. **Block (or Sector) Buffering**

* Disk reads and writes are done in blocks (also called pages).
* Typical block sizes range from 512 bytes to 4 KB or more.
* Multiple records can be stored in one block.
* Blocks reduce overhead of mechanical movements by transferring larger chunks of data per operation.

#### 5. **Disk Scheduling Algorithms**

* To improve performance when servicing multiple requests:

  * **FCFS (First-Come, First-Served):** Simple, but can cause long delays.
  * **SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First):** Selects request closest to current head position.
  * **SCAN (Elevator Algorithm):** Head moves in one direction servicing requests until end, then reverses.
  * **C-SCAN:** Like SCAN but returns to beginning without servicing requests on return.
* These algorithms reduce average seek time and improve throughput.

#### 6. **Reliability and Fault Tolerance**

* Magnetic disks are mechanical and susceptible to failures due to moving parts.
* Errors can occur due to head crashes, bad sectors, or platter degradation.
* Systems often use error detection and correction codes (ECC).
* Use of RAID to provide redundancy and improve fault tolerance.

#### 7. **Summary**

* Magnetic disks provide non-volatile, large-capacity secondary storage.
* Performance is governed by mechanical movement (seek and rotational latency).
* Data organized into tracks, sectors, and cylinders.
* Disk scheduling and buffering are critical to optimize disk utilization.

### Buffering of Blocks (Detailed Explanation)

#### 1. **Concept of Buffering**

* Buffering refers to temporarily storing data blocks from disk into main memory buffers.
* Purpose: Minimize slow disk I/O operations by caching frequently or recently accessed data.
* Buffers act as intermediaries between disk storage (slow) and CPU/main memory (fast).

#### 2. **Why Buffering is Needed**

* Disk access is orders of magnitude slower than memory access.
* Reading or writing a disk block each time from/to the disk is expensive in time.
* Buffering reduces the number of physical disk accesses.
* Supports efficient management of concurrent transactions and queries.

#### 3. **Buffer Manager**

* A component of the database management system responsible for:

  * Allocating buffers in main memory.
  * Managing the contents of buffers.
  * Deciding which blocks to read into or write back from buffers.
* Interfaces with disk subsystem and query processor.

#### 4. **Buffer Pool**

* A reserved portion of main memory divided into fixed-size buffer frames.
* Each buffer frame can hold one disk block.
* The size of the buffer pool affects overall system performance.

#### 5. **Buffering Policies**

##### a) **Replacement Policies**

* When the buffer pool is full and a new block is needed, a block must be evicted.
* Common policies:

  * **LRU (Least Recently Used):** Evict the block that was least recently accessed.
  * **MRU (Most Recently Used):** Evict the block most recently accessed (rarely used).
  * **Clock Algorithm:** A practical approximation of LRU using a circular buffer and reference bits.
  * **FIFO (First In First Out):** Evict the oldest block in buffer.
* Goal: Maximize the hit rate, i.e., probability that requested block is already in buffer.

##### b) **Pinning**

* Blocks currently being used are **pinned** in buffer so they are not evicted.
* Prevents losing data or inconsistencies during I/O operations.

##### c) **Write Policies**

* **Write-Through:** Data written to buffer is immediately written to disk.
* **Write-Back:** Data is written to buffer and marked dirty; actual disk write delayed until replacement.
* Write-back improves performance but requires careful recovery mechanisms.

#### 6. **Buffering and Transaction Management**

* Buffer manager interacts with concurrency control and recovery components.
* Ensures dirty blocks (modified but not yet on disk) are properly managed.
* Supports logging and checkpointing for crash recovery.

#### 7. **Advantages of Buffering**

* Reduces number of physical I/O operations.
* Improves throughput and latency.
* Enables effective management of concurrent access.
* Facilitates block-level read/write optimization.

#### 8. **Summary**

* Buffering of blocks is essential for efficient disk I/O.
* Managed by buffer pool and buffer manager using replacement and pinning policies.
* Balances memory usage and disk access to optimize database performance.

### Placing of File Records on Disk (T1 Level Detailed Explanation)

#### 1. **Introduction**

* Placing file records on disk refers to how records are physically stored in disk blocks.
* Efficient placement affects performance of retrieval, insertion, deletion, and update operations.

#### 2. **Basic Concepts**

* **Record:** Logical data unit (e.g., a row in a table).
* **Block (Page):** Physical unit of data transfer between disk and memory, usually contains multiple records.
* **File:** Collection of records stored across multiple blocks.

#### 3. **Record Placement Strategies**

##### a) **Contiguous Placement**

* Records placed sequentially one after another in contiguous disk blocks.
* Advantages:

  * Efficient for sequential access.
  * Minimizes seek and rotational latency for scanning records.
* Disadvantages:

  * Difficult to insert new records if space is full (may require moving other records).
  * File size expansion may require relocating or fragmenting the file.

##### b) **Linked Allocation**

* Records stored in blocks linked by pointers.
* Each block contains a pointer to the next block storing a record.
* Advantages:

  * Easy to grow file by adding blocks.
  * No need for contiguous free space.
* Disadvantages:

  * Random access is inefficient because traversal is required.
  * Overhead of pointers reduces usable storage.

##### c) **Indexed Allocation**

* An index structure holds pointers to all blocks containing records.
* Enables direct access to any block via index lookup.
* Advantages:

  * Supports efficient random access.
  * File can be scattered across disk.
* Disadvantages:

  * Requires extra space for index.
  * Overhead in maintaining index on insert/delete.

#### 4. **Record Blocking and Packing**

* Multiple fixed-length or variable-length records are packed into a single block to utilize space efficiently.
* Blocking reduces number of I/O operations by reading/writing multiple records at once.

#### 5. **Slotted Page Structure (for Variable-length Records)**

* Block contains a directory (slot table) indicating locations of records within the block.
* Enables insertion/deletion without moving entire block data.
* Supports variable-length records efficiently.

#### 6. **Summary**

* Record placement on disk is crucial for performance and space utilization.
* Common methods: contiguous, linked, and indexed placement.
* Blocking records into pages reduces I/O overhead.
* Choice depends on access patterns and update frequency.

---
### RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) — Detailed Explanation (T2 Level)

#### 1. **Introduction**

* RAID is a technology that uses multiple physical disks to improve performance, fault tolerance, and reliability.
* It combines several disks into a single logical unit.
* Developed to overcome limitations of single-disk systems, such as slow speed and data loss risk.

#### 2. **RAID Objectives**

* **Improved Performance:** Parallelism in read/write operations across disks.
* **Fault Tolerance:** Ability to continue operation despite disk failures.
* **Increased Capacity:** Combining storage space of multiple disks.

#### 3. **RAID Concepts**

##### a) **Striping**

* Data split into chunks (stripes) and spread across multiple disks.
* Enables parallel access and improves throughput.
* No redundancy in pure striping (RAID 0), so no fault tolerance.

##### b) **Mirroring**

* Data duplicated exactly on two or more disks.
* Provides fault tolerance by maintaining copies.
* Write operations slower due to duplication; read operations can be faster (reads can be balanced).

##### c) **Parity**

* Extra parity information calculated and stored for error detection and correction.
* Parity blocks enable reconstruction of lost data when one disk fails.
* Saves space compared to full mirroring.

#### 4. **Common RAID Levels**

| RAID Level        | Description                             | Features                                    | Fault Tolerance                                   | Performance                           | Storage Efficiency            |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **RAID 0**        | Striping without redundancy             | Fastest read/write; no fault tolerance      | None                                              | High (parallel I/O)                   | 100% (no redundancy)          |
| **RAID 1**        | Mirroring                               | Data duplicated exactly                     | Can tolerate 1 disk failure                       | Read speed improved; write slower     | 50% (half space for mirror)   |
| **RAID 5**        | Striping with distributed parity        | Parity blocks spread over all disks         | Can tolerate 1 disk failure                       | Good read; write slower due to parity | (N-1)/N (N = number of disks) |
| **RAID 6**        | Striping with double distributed parity | Two parity blocks for extra fault tolerance | Can tolerate 2 disk failures                      | Read similar to RAID 5; write slower  | (N-2)/N                       |
| **RAID 10 (1+0)** | Combination of mirroring and striping   | High performance and fault tolerance        | Can tolerate multiple failures depending on disks | Very high                             | 50%                           |

#### 5. **RAID Implementation Details**

##### a) **Data Layout**

* Data blocks and parity blocks are distributed across disks.
* Parity computed using XOR operation on data blocks.

##### b) **Fault Recovery**

* On disk failure, data reconstructed from parity and remaining disks.
* Rebuild process involves reading all remaining data and recalculating lost data.

##### c) **Write Penalty**

* Writing data involves updating parity information, causing extra I/O overhead.
* RAID 5 and RAID 6 suffer from write penalty due to parity updates.

#### 6. **Advantages of RAID**

* Improved data availability.
* Increased throughput via parallelism.
* Scalable storage capacity.

#### 7. **Disadvantages of RAID**

* Added complexity in hardware/software.
* Increased cost due to additional disks.
* Write performance penalties for parity-based RAID levels.

#### 8. **Summary**

* RAID is a key technology for reliable and high-performance disk storage.
* Multiple RAID levels offer trade-offs among performance, reliability, and cost.
* RAID 0 prioritizes speed; RAID 1 prioritizes redundancy; RAID 5 and 6 balance both with parity.
* Choice depends on application requirements.

### File Organization in ADBMS — Detailed Explanation

#### 1. **Definition**

* File organization refers to the way records are arranged and stored within a file on secondary storage.
* It affects the efficiency of data retrieval, insertion, deletion, and updating operations.

#### 2. **Types of File Organizations**

##### a) **Heap File Organization (Unordered Files)**

* Records are stored in no particular order.
* New records are appended at the end of the file.
* **Advantages:**

  * Simple and efficient for bulk loading.
  * Fast insertion (just append).
* **Disadvantages:**

  * Inefficient for searching unless full file scan is done.
  * No ordering means no quick access using keys.
* **Use Cases:**

  * Temporary files, staging areas, or when retrieval is mostly full scan.

##### b) **Sorted File Organization**

* Records are stored in order based on one or more key fields.
* Enables efficient searching using binary search or indexes.
* **Advantages:**

  * Efficient for range queries.
  * Enables binary search, reducing access time.
* **Disadvantages:**

  * Insertion and deletion are costly due to maintaining sorted order (records may need shifting).
  * Reorganization may be needed over time to avoid fragmentation.
* **Use Cases:**

  * Applications with frequent range queries or ordered data retrieval.

##### c) **Hashed File Organization**

* Records placed into buckets using a hash function on the key.
* Hash function maps key values to specific buckets.
* Enables direct access to records via hash key.
* **Advantages:**

  * Very fast equality search operations.
  * Efficient insertion and deletion (usually just hash and insert/delete in bucket).
* **Disadvantages:**

  * Poor for range queries since hashing destroys order.
  * Handling collisions (overflow buckets or chaining) can complicate management.
* **Use Cases:**

  * Applications where fast lookup by exact key is required.

#### 3. **Comparison of File Organizations**

| Feature           | Heap Files         | Sorted Files                | Hashed Files               |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Search Efficiency | Linear scan        | Binary search               | Direct access via hash     |
| Insert Efficiency | Very high (append) | Low (maintain order)        | High (hash and insert)     |
| Delete Efficiency | Requires scan      | Costly (maintain order)     | Efficient (hash lookup)    |
| Range Queries     | Inefficient        | Efficient                   | Inefficient                |
| Storage Overhead  | Low                | Medium (due to maintenance) | Medium (due to collisions) |

#### 4. **Additional Considerations**

* **File Reorganization:** Periodically needed in sorted and hashed files to maintain efficiency.
* **Overflow Handling:** In hashed files, overflow buckets used to handle collisions.
* **Buffer Management:** Different file organizations interact differently with buffer policies.

#### 5. **Summary**

* Choice of file organization depends on application access patterns.
* Heap files are simplest but least efficient for selective access.
* Sorted files support ordered queries efficiently but have higher maintenance costs.
* Hashed files excel at equality searches but do not support range queries well.

### Indexed File Organization — Detailed Explanation

#### 1. **Definition**

* Indexed file organization uses an index structure to provide fast access to records.
* The index acts like a lookup table mapping keys to record locations (blocks or record pointers).

#### 2. **Purpose of Indexing**

* To avoid full file scans for query processing.
* To enable efficient search, especially for equality and range queries.
* To speed up retrieval, insertion, and deletion.

#### 3. **Types of Indexes**

##### a) **Primary Index**

* Built on a sorted file using the primary key.
* One index entry per data block pointing to the first record in the block.
* Index entries stored in sorted order.
* Efficient for range and equality queries.

##### b) **Secondary Index**

* Built on non-primary key attributes.
* Allows fast access by fields other than the primary key.
* May contain multiple entries for the same key (non-unique).

##### c) **Clustered Index**

* The data records themselves are stored in the same order as the index.
* Improves performance for range queries.

##### d) **Non-Clustered Index**

* Index is stored separately; records are not physically ordered according to the index.
* May require additional lookups to fetch records.

#### 4. **Index Structures**

##### a) **Single-Level Index**

* A simple index containing entries (key, pointer).
* Useful for small files.
* Index size may become large for big files.

##### b) **Multilevel Index**

* Hierarchical index with multiple levels.
* Top levels index lower levels, bottom level points to data.
* Reduces index search time from O(n) to O(log n).

##### c) **Dense vs Sparse Index**

* **Dense Index:** Index entry for every search key value.
* **Sparse Index:** Index entries only for some keys (e.g., first key in each block).

#### 5. **Common Indexing Methods**

##### a) **ISAM (Indexed Sequential Access Method)**

* Static multi-level index.
* Data file is sequential and sorted.
* Insertions may cause overflow areas.
* Efficient for mostly read-only databases.

##### b) **B+ Tree**

* Balanced tree index structure.
* Dynamic and supports insertions/deletions without overflow.
* Leaves contain pointers to actual records.
* Supports efficient equality and range queries.
* Height balanced, typically low height (3-4 levels for large files).

##### c) **Hash Index**

* Indexing via hash function on key.
* Enables direct access to records.
* Good for equality queries.
* Poor for range queries.
* Used in hashed file organizations.

#### 6. **Index Maintenance**

* Indexes must be updated when records are inserted, deleted, or modified.
* Overhead involved in maintaining indexes.

#### 7. **Advantages of Indexing**

* Greatly improves search performance.
* Supports efficient range and equality queries.
* Can support multiple indexes per file on different keys.

#### 8. **Disadvantages**

* Additional storage space needed for indexes.
* Overhead on insertions, deletions, and updates.
* Complexity in maintaining consistency.

### Hashing in File Organization — Detailed Explanation

#### 1. **Definition**

* Hashing is a technique to directly map a search key to a location (bucket) in storage using a hash function.
* Enables fast access to records via key-based retrieval.

#### 2. **Basic Concepts**

##### a) **Hash Function**

* A function `h(key)` that computes an address or bucket number from a key.
* Ideal hash functions distribute keys uniformly to minimize collisions.

##### b) **Bucket**

* Storage unit that holds one or more records.
* Usually corresponds to a disk block or page.

#### 3. **Static Hashing**

##### a) **Characteristics**

* Fixed number of buckets.
* Hash function maps keys to buckets in a fixed range.
* Collisions handled via overflow buckets or chaining.

##### b) **Advantages**

* Simple implementation.
* Fast access for equality queries.

##### c) **Disadvantages**

* Poor handling of database growth; fixed bucket number leads to overflow if many inserts.
* Performance degrades as overflow chains grow.
* Not suitable for range queries.

#### 4. **Dynamic Hashing**

##### a) **Need**

* Overcomes static hashing’s limitation in handling growing or shrinking databases.

##### b) **Techniques**

* **Extendible Hashing:**

  * Uses a directory of pointers indexed by a hash prefix.
  * Directory doubles in size when buckets overflow.
  * Supports dynamic growth without massive rehashing.
* **Linear Hashing:**

  * Gradually expands the hash table by splitting buckets in a linear order.
  * No directory needed; expansion is incremental.

##### c) **Advantages**

* Dynamic adjustment of hash table size.
* Efficient insertions and deletions.
* Maintains constant access time on average.

##### d) **Disadvantages**

* Slightly more complex to implement than static hashing.
* Not suitable for range queries.

#### 5. **Collision Resolution Techniques**

* **Chaining:** Each bucket contains a linked list of records.
* **Open Addressing:** Probes for next free bucket on collision (less common in disk-based hashing).

#### 6. **Performance Considerations**

* Hashing provides O(1) average time for search, insert, and delete.
* Performance depends on uniformity of hash function and collision handling.
* Inefficient for queries other than equality (no order preserved).

#### 7. **Summary**

| Aspect            | Static Hashing               | Dynamic Hashing                                                   |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bucket Number     | Fixed                        | Grows/shrinks dynamically                                         |
| Handling Overflow | Overflow buckets or chaining | Directory doubling (extendible) or incremental splitting (linear) |
| Suitable Queries  | Equality only                | Equality only                                                     |
| Complexity        | Simple                       | Moderate                                                          |
| Use Cases         | Small, stable datasets       | Large or variable datasets                                        |

| **Complexity**                       | More complex due to tree structures and index updates                              | Simpler structure; relies on hash function                    |
| **Handling of Collisions/Conflicts** | Not applicable; index structure handles ordering and pointers                      | Collisions handled by chaining or overflow buckets            |
| **Performance Stability**            | Performance remains stable with balanced trees                                     | Performance may degrade if hash collisions increase           |
| **Use Cases**                        | Databases requiring both range and equality searches; large datasets               | Applications needing fast equality lookups; simple key access |
| **Examples**                         | B+ Trees, ISAM                                                                     | Static Hashing, Extendible Hashing, Linear Hashing            |

---

**Summary:**

* Requires finding the record.
* Update in place if key remains same.
* If key changes, record may need to be deleted and reinserted.

#### 4. **Advantages**

* Efficient for range queries (e.g., find all records between two key values).
* Fast search for individual records using binary search.
* Easier to maintain clustered indexes on sorted files.

#### 5. **Disadvantages**

* Insertions and deletions are expensive due to shifting and maintaining order.
* Frequent updates may degrade performance.
* May require periodic reorganization to avoid fragmentation.

#### 6. **Use Cases**

* Applications with frequent range queries.
* Read-intensive databases.
* Situations where sorted data access is critical.

---

### Hashed File Organization — Detailed Explanation

#### 1. **Definition**

* Records are stored in buckets determined by a hash function applied to a key.
* Allows direct access to the bucket where the record is stored.

#### 2. **Structure**

* File consists of multiple buckets or blocks.
* Each bucket can hold one or more records.
* Hash function `h(key)` computes the bucket number.

#### 3. **Operations**

##### a) **Insertion**

* Compute hash value for the record key.
* Insert record into the corresponding bucket.
* If bucket is full, handle overflow via chaining or overflow buckets.

##### b) **Search**

* Compute hash of the search key.
* Access corresponding bucket directly.
* Search bucket for the record.
* Efficient for equality queries.

##### c) **Deletion**

* Locate record by hash and bucket.
* Remove record from bucket or overflow area.

##### d) **Update**

* Find record via hash lookup.
* Update in place if key remains same.
* If key changes, delete and reinsert may be needed.

#### 4. **Types of Hashing**

##### a) **Static Hashing**

* Fixed number of buckets.
* Hash function maps keys into these buckets.
* Overflow handled by chaining or overflow buckets.
* Performance degrades as data grows and overflow increases.

##### b) **Dynamic Hashing**

* Number of buckets can grow or shrink dynamically.
* Examples include:

  * **Extendible Hashing:** Uses a directory and splits buckets when needed.
  * **Linear Hashing:** Gradually splits buckets in a linear order without directory.

#### 5. **Advantages**

* Very fast equality search.
* Efficient insertions and deletions.
* Simple to implement (especially static hashing).

#### 6. **Disadvantages**

* Does not support range queries efficiently (no ordering).
* Static hashing can suffer performance issues due to overflow.
* Dynamic hashing is more complex to implement.
* Collisions must be carefully handled.

#### 7. **Use Cases**

* Applications with frequent equality-based queries.
* Large, dynamic datasets requiring efficient insertions and lookups.

### Choosing File Organization — Detailed Explanation

#### 1. **Factors Influencing Choice**

* Access patterns (types of queries).
* Frequency of insertions, deletions, and updates.
* Size of the data and storage constraints.
* Need for range queries or exact-match queries.
* Performance requirements for search, insert, and delete operations.
* Complexity and overhead of maintaining the file structure.

#### 2. **Access Patterns**

| Access Pattern                | Recommended File Organization            |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Frequent full scans           | Heap files                               |
| Frequent equality search      | Hashed files or Indexed files            |
| Frequent range queries        | Sorted files or Indexed files (B+ Trees) |
| Mostly insertions             | Heap files or Hashed files               |
| Balanced insert/delete/search | Indexed files (B+ Trees)                 |

#### 3. **Insertions**

* If inserts dominate, heap or hashed files preferred due to fast insertions.
* Sorted files have costly insertions due to maintaining order.

#### 4. **Search Requirements**

* For equality searches: hashing or indexing offers fast access.
* For range searches: sorted files or indexes (like B+ Trees) are suitable.
* Heap files are inefficient for selective searches.

#### 5. **Updates and Deletions**

* Updates may be easier in indexed or hashed files depending on the key.
* Deletions in heap files require scanning; in hashed/indexed files they are more efficient.

#### 6. **Storage and Maintenance Overhead**

* Indexed files require extra storage for index structures.
* Hashed files require careful collision and overflow management.
* Sorted files may need periodic reorganization.

#### 7. **Summary Guidelines**

| Scenario                                   | Best File Organization               |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Bulk loading and sequential processing     | Heap files                           |
| Fast equality search with frequent inserts | Hashed files                         |
| Range queries and ordered retrieval        | Sorted files with indexing (B+ Tree) |
| Mixed workload with balanced operations    | Indexed files                        |

### Choosing File Organization — Detailed Explanation

#### 1. **Relation Between Choosing and File Organization**

* Choosing the right file organization means selecting the appropriate method (heap, sorted, hashed, or indexed) based on application needs and data access patterns.
* File organization defines how records are physically stored; choosing depends on workload characteristics, performance requirements, and query types.

#### 2. **Criteria for Choosing File Organization**

##### a) **Type of Queries**

* **Equality queries:** Favor hashed or indexed files.
* **Range queries:** Favor sorted or indexed files with ordering (e.g., B+ trees).
* **Full scans:** Heap files or sorted files can be efficient.

##### b) **Frequency of Insertions and Updates**

* Frequent insertions: Heap files or hashed files are better due to faster insertions.
* Frequent updates: Indexed or hashed files can provide efficient access for updates.
* Sorted files may suffer from slow insertions and updates due to order maintenance.

##### c) **Data Volume and Growth**

* Large and growing datasets favor dynamic hashing or indexing for scalable performance.
* Small or static datasets might work well with static hashing or sorted files.

##### d) **Performance Considerations**

* Need for fast search favors indexed or hashed files.
* Need for fast sequential access favors heap or sorted files.
* Consider storage overhead: indexes require extra space; hashed files require overflow management.

##### e) **Maintenance Overhead**

* Sorted and indexed files require reorganization or balancing.
* Hashing needs collision and overflow handling.
* Heap files have minimal maintenance.

#### 3. **Examples of Choosing Based on Scenario**

| Scenario                             | Suitable File Organization    |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Bulk insertions with few searches    | Heap files                    |
| Fast lookup by key                   | Hashed files or indexed files |
| Range queries and sorted output      | Sorted files with indexing    |
| Mixed workload with balanced queries | Indexed files (B+ tree)       |

#### 4. **Summary**

* The choice is a trade-off between insertion speed, search efficiency, support for range queries, and maintenance cost.
* Application requirements must be analyzed carefully to select the most suitable file organization.

### Overview of Indexes — Detailed Explanation

#### 1. **Definition**

* An index is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table at the cost of additional writes and storage space.
* It acts like a lookup table that allows quick access to records without scanning the entire file.

#### 2. **Purpose**

* To accelerate query processing by reducing the number of disk I/O operations.
* To provide efficient access paths for various types of queries (equality, range).

#### 3. **Basic Concepts**

##### a) **Search Key**

* Attribute or set of attributes on which the index is built.
* Often the primary key or any attribute frequently used in queries.

##### b) **Data Entry**

* The actual content stored in the index.
* Can be of three types (explained in detail below).

##### c) **Index Key**

* The key value stored in the index.

##### d) **Pointer/Record Identifier (RID)**

* Points to the actual record or block containing the data.

#### 4. **Types of Data Entries in an Index**

##### a) **Data Entry contains the Actual Data Record**

* Index is a copy of the data sorted by the search key.
* Used for small datasets or when the index contains all the needed attributes (covering index).

##### b) **Data Entry contains a Pointer to the Data Record**

* Most common method.
* Index entries store (search key, pointer to record).
* Data stored separately in the data file.

##### c) **Data Entry contains a Pointer to a Bucket of Records**

* Used for non-unique keys.
* Multiple records can have the same key.
* Index points to a bucket containing all records with the same key.

#### 5. **Types of Indexes**

##### a) **Primary Index**

* Built on sorted data file based on the primary key.
* Unique and ordered.

##### b) **Secondary Index**

* Built on non-primary keys.
* Allows searching by other attributes.

##### c) **Clustered Index**

* Data file records are stored in the same order as the index.
* Usually one clustered index per table.

##### d) **Non-clustered Index**

* Index order differs from physical record order.
* Multiple non-clustered indexes can exist on a table.

#### 6. **Advantages of Indexes**

* Faster data retrieval.
* Support for complex query conditions.
* Efficient range and equality searches.

#### 7. **Disadvantages**

* Additional storage overhead.
* Overhead in maintaining the index during insertions, deletions, and updates.
* Can slow down write operations due to index maintenance.

### Summary Table: Data Entry Types

| Data Entry Type              | Description                                          | Use Case                       |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Actual Data Record           | Index stores actual record data                      | Small datasets, covering index |
| Pointer to Data Record       | Index stores (key, record pointer)                   | Most common                    |
| Pointer to Bucket of Records | Index stores pointer to group of records sharing key | Non-unique keys                |

---
### Alternatives of Data Entries in an Index — Detailed Explanation

In an index structure, the **data entries** represent the information stored at the leaf nodes or in the index that connects the search key to the actual data. There are three main alternatives for what the data entries can contain:

---

#### 1. **Data Entry Contains the Actual Data Record**

* The index stores a copy of the full record.
* Useful when the indexed fields cover the entire record (called a **covering index**).
* The index itself can be used to answer queries without accessing the actual data file.

**Advantages:**

* Query processing can be faster since data is retrieved directly from the index.
* Reduces I/O if all needed data is in the index.

**Disadvantages:**

* Requires more storage space because records are duplicated in the index.
* Updating data requires updating the index as well.

**Use Case:**

* Small tables or indexes on small sets of attributes.

---

#### 2. **Data Entry Contains a Pointer to the Data Record**

* The index entry stores the search key value along with a pointer (record identifier - RID) to the actual data record stored elsewhere.
* Most common alternative.

**Advantages:**

* Saves space in the index by storing pointers instead of full records.
* Index is smaller and faster to search.

**Disadvantages:**

* Query requires an extra I/O to access the actual data record after index lookup.
* Pointer validity must be maintained.

**Use Case:**

* General-purpose indexing in large databases.

---

#### 3. **Data Entry Contains a Pointer to a Bucket of Records**

* Used when the search key is **not unique** and multiple records share the same key value.
* Each index entry points to a bucket (or list) containing pointers to all data records with that key.

**Advantages:**

* Efficient handling of duplicate keys.
* Reduces redundancy by grouping pointers.

**Disadvantages:**

* Bucket management complexity.
* May require additional storage for buckets.

**Use Case:**

* Secondary indexes on non-unique attributes.

| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Actual Data Record           | Full record stored in index               | Covering indexes, small tables     |
| Pointer to Data Record       | Key value + pointer to record             | Most common, large datasets        |
| Pointer to Bucket of Records | Key value + pointer to bucket of pointers | Non-unique keys, secondary indexes |

### Properties of Indexes — Detailed Explanation

#### 1. **Search Key**

* The attribute(s) on which the index is built.
* Should uniquely or adequately identify records to optimize search.
* Determines how records are accessed (equality, range queries).

#### 2. **Ordering**

* Index entries are usually stored in a sorted order by search key.
* Enables efficient binary search and range queries.

#### 3. **Uniqueness**

* Index can be **unique** or **non-unique**.
* Unique index: search key uniquely identifies a single record.
* Non-unique index: multiple records may share the same key.

#### 4. **Clustering**

* **Clustered Index:**

  * The order of records in the data file matches the order of the index.
  * Only one clustered index per file.
  * Improves performance of range queries.
* **Non-clustered Index:**

  * Data order is independent of index order.
  * Allows multiple non-clustered indexes.

#### 5. **Depth (Height)**

* The number of levels in the index structure.
* Lower depth means faster search.
* For B+ Trees, depth is typically low (3-4 levels).

#### 6. **Fan-out**

* Number of pointers per index node.
* Higher fan-out reduces index height and disk I/O.

#### 7. **Space Overhead**

* Index requires extra storage space beyond the data.
* Size depends on number of entries and structure type.

#### 8. **Access Types Supported**

* Equality queries.
* Range queries.
* Prefix queries (for composite keys).
* Nearest neighbor searches (in advanced indexes).

#### 9. **Maintenance Overhead**

* Index must be updated on insert, delete, or update operations.
* Balanced trees (like B+ Trees) require rebalancing.

#### 10. **Fault Tolerance**

* Some index structures support recovery and crash resistance.
* Critical for databases with high availability needs.

* Provides both sequential and direct access to records.
* One of the earliest and classic indexing techniques.

#### 2. **Structure**

##### a) **Data File**

* Records stored sequentially on disk, sorted by key.
* Data is organized in fixed-size blocks.

##### b) **Index File**

* Multi-level index structure.
* Index contains entries of the form (key value, pointer to data block).
* Top-level indexes point to lower-level index blocks.
* Lowest-level index points to data blocks.

#### 3. **Characteristics**

* Designed for mostly read-only or infrequently updated databases.
* Insertions and deletions can lead to overflow areas.

#### 4. **Insertion and Deletion**

* **Insertion:**

  * New records inserted into overflow or "overflow areas" because data file is static and sorted.
  * Overflow chains can grow and degrade performance.
  * Periodic reorganization is required to merge overflow data into the main file.

* **Deletion:**

  * Mark record as deleted; physical removal may require reorganization.

#### 5. **Search Operation**

* Search starts at the highest-level index.
* Uses index entries to navigate to the appropriate data block.
* Within the block, sequential search is performed to find the record.

#### 6. **Advantages**

* Efficient for large sequential and equality searches.
* Supports both sequential and direct access.
* Simple and reliable.

#### 7. **Disadvantages**

* Index is static; cannot adjust dynamically to data growth.
* Insertions lead to overflow areas and performance degradation.
* Requires periodic file reorganization.
* Not suitable for databases with frequent updates.

#### 8. **Use Cases**

* Read-heavy applications with infrequent updates.
* Legacy systems and early database implementations.

### Hashing — Detailed Explanation

#### 1. **Definition**

* Hashing is a technique to map search keys directly to the location of their records using a hash function.
* Enables fast data retrieval by computing an address where the record is stored.

#### 2. **Hash Function**

* A function `h(key)` that converts a key into a bucket number or address.
* Should uniformly distribute keys to minimize collisions.

#### 3. **Hash Table Structure**

* Consists of buckets (blocks/pages) that hold records.
* Each bucket can hold multiple records.

#### 4. **Collision Handling**

* When two keys hash to the same bucket (collision), handled by:

  * **Chaining:** Each bucket contains a linked list of records.
  * **Open Addressing:** Probing for next free bucket (less common in disk-based systems).

#### 5. **Static Hashing**

* Fixed number of buckets.
* Hash function and bucket count do not change.
* Overflow buckets or chains handle excess data.
* Performance degrades with growth.

#### 6. **Dynamic Hashing**

* Number of buckets can grow/shrink dynamically.
* Examples:

  * **Extendible Hashing:** Uses a directory; doubles directory size when buckets overflow.
  * **Linear Hashing:** Gradually splits buckets in a linear fashion without directory.
* Maintains efficient access as data grows.

#### 7. **Advantages**

* Very fast equality search (O(1) average).
* Efficient insertion and deletion.
* Simple implementation for static hashing.

#### 8. **Disadvantages**

* Poor support for range queries.
* Static hashing suffers from overflow issues.
* Dynamic hashing more complex to implement.

---

### Introduction to Static Hashing — Detailed Explanation

#### 1. **Definition**

* Static hashing is a file organization method where the number of buckets (storage locations) is fixed at the time of creation.
* A hash function maps each search key to a fixed bucket number.
* Used for fast equality-based searches.

#### 2. **Structure**

* A hash table with a predetermined number of buckets.
* Each bucket corresponds to a disk block or page that can hold multiple records.
* Buckets store records whose keys hash to that bucket.

#### 3. **Hash Function**

* A function `h(key) = key mod N`, where N is the fixed number of buckets.
* Keys uniformly distributed to reduce collisions.

#### 4. **Collision Handling**

* When multiple keys map to the same bucket (collision), collisions are handled by:

  * **Overflow Buckets:** Additional buckets chained to the primary bucket.
  * **Chaining:** Using linked lists in buckets.

#### 5. **Operations**

##### a) **Search**

* Compute hash of the key to find the bucket.
* Search within the bucket and overflow area if any.

##### b) **Insertion**

* Compute bucket from hash function.
* Insert record in primary bucket or overflow area if full.

##### c) **Deletion**

* Locate bucket via hash.
* Delete record from bucket or overflow chain.

#### 6. **Advantages**

* Simple and fast for equality searches.
* Easy to implement.

#### 7. **Disadvantages**

* Fixed bucket count causes overflow as data grows.
* Performance degrades with overflow chains.
* Not suitable for range queries.
* Requires periodic rehashing or file reorganization if data grows too large.

#### 8. **Use Cases**

* Applications with relatively stable data sizes.
* Situations where fast exact-match retrieval is critical.

---

### Introduction to Dynamic Hashing — Detailed Explanation

#### 1. **Definition**

* Dynamic hashing is a hashing technique that allows the hash table to grow and shrink dynamically as the database size changes.
* Avoids the limitations of static hashing, which uses a fixed number of buckets.
* Maintains efficient search, insert, and delete operations even as data volume changes.

#### 2. **Motivation**

* In static hashing, fixed bucket count leads to overflow as data grows, causing performance degradation.
* Dynamic hashing adapts bucket allocation to handle data growth without costly reorganization.

#### 3. **Key Concepts**

##### a) **Directory**

* A table of pointers to buckets.
* Can double in size to accommodate more buckets.

##### b) **Buckets**

* Storage units for records.
* Number of buckets can increase or decrease.

##### c) **Hash Function**

* Produces bit strings.
* Uses a prefix of hash bits to index into the directory.

#### 4. **Common Dynamic Hashing Techniques**

##### a) **Extendible Hashing**

* Uses a directory indexed by a fixed number of bits from the hash value.
* Directory size doubles when buckets overflow.
* Buckets split, and pointers in the directory updated accordingly.
* Supports efficient equality queries.

##### b) **Linear Hashing**

* Gradually increases the number of buckets by splitting them one at a time.
* Does not use a directory.
* Splitting occurs in a linear order.
* Simpler directory management.

#### 5. **Advantages**

* Supports dynamic database size changes efficiently.
* Avoids overflow chains, maintaining constant access times.
* Efficient insert, search, and delete operations.
* Better space utilization than static hashing.

#### 6. **Disadvantages**

* More complex implementation compared to static hashing.

| **Directory**                 | Usually no directory; fixed bucket structure.                                        | May use directory (extendible hashing) or no directory (linear hashing).                                                                |
| **Range Queries**             | Not supported efficiently.                                                           | Also not efficient for range queries.                                                                                                   |
| **Insertion**                 | Simple; insert into bucket or overflow area.                                         | More complex; may cause bucket splitting and directory updates.                                                                         |
| **Deletion**                  | Locate bucket, delete record; overflow chains complicate.                            | Locate and delete; balanced bucket management.                                                                                          |
| **Search Performance**        | Fast if few collisions; slows with overflow.                                         | Consistently fast due to dynamic adjustment.                                                                                            |
| **Implementation Complexity** | Simpler to implement.                                                                | More complex due to dynamic directory and splitting.                                                                                    |
| **Maintenance**               | Periodic rehashing/reorganization required if data grows significantly.              | Self-adjusting; no need for periodic reorganization.                                                                                    |
| **Use Cases**                 | Stable datasets with known size.                                                     | Large, dynamic datasets with unpredictable growth.                                                                                      |

### Summary

#### Static Hashing

* Uses a fixed number of buckets.
* Overflow chains occur when buckets are full, degrading performance.
* Simple but inflexible.
* Requires periodic reorganization for large growth.

#### Dynamic Hashing

* Buckets grow/shrink dynamically.
* Avoids overflow through bucket splitting.
* Maintains efficient search and insertion times.
* More complex but better suited for dynamic datasets.
