* **Move(x, y, z):** Move block $x$ from block or table $y$ to block or table $z$.
* Constraints include:

  * Only one block can be moved at a time.
  * A block can only be moved if it has no block on top (i.e., it is clear).
  * Blocks can be placed either on the table or on another clear block.

---

#### **4. Problem Characteristics**

* **Deterministic:** Actions have predictable effects.
* **Discrete and Finite:** Limited number of blocks and configurations.
* **Well-Defined Goals:** The goal is a particular block arrangement.

---
### **Goal Stack Planning**

---

#### **1. Definition**

* Goal Stack Planning is a **planning technique** that manages goals and subgoals using a **stack data structure**.
* It decomposes complex goals into simpler subgoals and solves them incrementally by pushing and popping goals on the stack.

---

#### **2. Working Principle**

* Starts with the **main goal** pushed onto the stack.
* Repeatedly:

  * Pop the top goal from the stack.
  * If it is already satisfied in the current state, discard it.
  * If not, find actions or subgoals required to achieve it.
  * Push those subgoals or actions onto the stack.
* Continues until the stack is empty and all goals are achieved.

---

#### **3. Steps**

1. Initialize the stack with the goal.
2. While the stack is not empty:

   * Look at the top element (goal or action).
   * If it is a goal and satisfied, pop it.
   * If it is a goal and not satisfied:

     * Find an action to achieve the goal.
     * Push the action and its preconditions (subgoals) onto the stack.
   * If it is an action:

     * Execute the action (or add it to the plan).
     * Update the current state.
     * Pop the action from the stack.

---

#### **4. Features**

| Feature            | Description                                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Data Structure** | Uses a stack to manage goals and actions                     |
| **Incremental**    | Breaks down goals into smaller, manageable subgoals          |
| **State-Driven**   | Checks current state to decide if goals are satisfied        |
| **Backtracking**   | Supports backtracking if actions fail or goals cannot be met |

---

#### **5. Example**

* Goal: Stack block A on block B.
* Stack initially: \[Stack A on B]
* Decompose into subgoals:

  * Clear A
  * Clear B
  * Move A onto B
* Push subgoals onto the stack and solve them one by one.

---

#### **6. Advantages**

---

### **Summary**

Goal Stack Planning is a method that uses a stack to manage and decompose goals into subgoals and actions, solving them incrementally by pushing and popping from the stack until the desired goals are achieved.

---
### **Nonlinear Planning Using Constraint Posting**

---

#### **1. Definition**

* Nonlinear planning is a planning approach where **actions are partially ordered**, not strictly sequential, allowing flexibility in execution order.
* **Constraint posting** is a technique used to represent and manage constraints between actions to ensure valid plans without committing prematurely to a total order.

---

#### **2. Key Concepts**

| Concept                | Description                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Partial Ordering**   | Actions can be executed in any order respecting constraints, enabling concurrency and flexibility.            |
| **Constraints**        | Conditions that specify the ordering or relationships between actions (e.g., action A must precede action B). |
| **Constraint Posting** | The process of adding ordering constraints to the plan as needed to prevent conflicts or violations.          |

---

#### **3. Working Principle**

* Starts with an **initial plan** consisting of a set of actions without a fixed order.
* **Causal links** are established to represent dependencies (e.g., an action provides a precondition for another).
* Constraints are posted to maintain consistency, such as:

  * Preventing actions from undoing each other's effects.
  * Ensuring that preconditions are satisfied when needed.
* The planner incrementally adds actions and constraints until a consistent plan is found that achieves the goal.

---

#### **4. Advantages**

* Allows more **efficient planning** by avoiding unnecessary ordering.
* Supports **parallel execution** of independent actions.
* Better models real-world scenarios with flexible action sequences.

---

#### **5. Challenges**

* Managing and resolving complex constraints can be computationally intensive.
* Requires sophisticated mechanisms to detect and resolve conflicts.

---

#### **6. Example**

* In Blocks World, instead of planning to move blocks strictly one after another, nonlinear planning allows moving different blocks concurrently if their actions do not conflict.
* Constraints are posted to ensure that, for example, a block is not moved before the block below it is clear.

---

#### **7. Applications**

* Robotics, where actions may overlap or be concurrent.
* Complex scheduling problems.
* Domains requiring flexibility and partial ordering of tasks.

---

### **Summary**

Nonlinear Planning using Constraint Posting is a flexible planning method that represents actions with partial orderings and incrementally adds constraints to ensure consistency, enabling concurrent and efficient execution of plans.
