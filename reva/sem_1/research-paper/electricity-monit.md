## 1. Introduction

Efficient energy management is crucial in both residential and industrial settings. Traditional methods of monitoring and controlling electrical systems often lack flexibility, real-time insights, and integration with modern technology. With the advent of IoT, it has become possible to design systems that not only provide remote control but also generate actionable insights by visualizing electrical flow dynamically.

The aim of this study is to develop a smart electrical flow control and monitoring system that utilizes sensors, microcontrollers, cloud platforms, and user-friendly interfaces. The proposed system ensures efficient energy management by visualizing data and offering automation capabilities. Special emphasis is placed on scaling the system for large infrastructures, such as 50-story buildings, and addressing the unique challenges posed by such environments.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Components

The architecture consists of the following components:

1. **Sensors:** Voltage and current sensors (e.g., ACS712, INA219) are used to measure electrical parameters.
2. **Microcontroller:** ESP32 serves as the central processing unit, collecting data from sensors and transmitting it.
3. **Communication Protocols:** MQTT is utilized for lightweight and efficient data transmission.
4. **Backend:** A cloud server processes and stores data for real-time and historical analysis.
5. **Frontend:** A web and mobile application provides a dynamic interface for monitoring and controlling devices.
6. **Database:** Data is stored in Firebase or an SQL-based database for persistence.

### 2.2 Data Flow

The data flow begins with sensors capturing electrical parameters, which are processed by the microcontroller. This data is then transmitted to a backend server using MQTT. The server processes the data and stores it in a database. The frontend application retrieves this data and visualizes it as a map of electrical flow, allowing users to interact with and control connected devices.

### 2.3 Dynamic Mapping for Multi-Story Buildings

For a 50-story building, the system includes a dynamic map visualization feature. Each floor has its own set of relays and sensors, and the application dynamically locates these devices and maps them in a hierarchical structure. Users can:

- Navigate between floors.
- Identify the location of relays and connected devices.
- View voltage levels and status in real-time.
- Control devices directly from the map interface.

To address scalability, the system minimizes latency and ensures reliability by optimizing data transmission and processing for high device counts.

## 3. Implementation

### 3.1 Hardware Setup

- **Voltage and Current Sensors:** Installed at critical points in the circuit to measure real-time parameters. For scalability, custom PCBs and circuit boards can replace off-the-shelf IoT sensors, reducing cost and complexity.
- **Microcontroller Configuration:** ESP32 is programmed to read sensor data and publish it to the MQTT broker.
- **Custom PCB Development:** For large-scale implementations, custom PCBs integrating voltage and current sensing, communication modules, and relays can be developed. This reduces the need for multiple standalone IoT devices.

### 3.2 Software Development

- **Backend:** Built using Flask for data processing and an MQTT broker for communication.
- **Database Management:** Historical data is stored in Firebase, while real-time data is cached for quick access.
- **Frontend Application:** Developed using React for web and Flutter for mobile, enabling users to view dynamic electrical flow maps and control devices.

### 3.3 Visualization

The frontend application employs D3.js to create interactive maps, with nodes representing devices and edges depicting electrical connections. Real-time updates are achieved using WebSockets. For 50-story buildings, users can zoom in and out of specific floors and access detailed statistics for each device.

## 4. Problems and Challenges

### 4.1 Scalability for Large Infrastructures

In a 50-story building, the sheer number of devices and sensors poses a challenge in terms of:

- **Device Location:** Accurately mapping the physical location of each relay and sensor.

### 4.2 Reliability and Maintenance

- IoT sensors can fail or drift over time, impacting data accuracy.
- Using off-the-shelf sensors may increase costs and complexity. Developing custom PCBs can address this issue but requires expertise and resources.

### 4.3 Security

- The system must prevent unauthorized access to control or monitor electrical devices.
- Encryption protocols like TLS for MQTT and secure user authentication are essential.
