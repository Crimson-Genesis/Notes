# **Unit 3: Software Modelling and Implementation**
## **Process Planning & Effort Estimation**  

### **📌 1. Process Planning**
Process planning is a key step in **software development** that helps define **tasks, resources, and schedules** needed to complete a project successfully.  

### **🔹 Key Steps in Process Planning**
1. **Define Project Goals** – Identify **scope, requirements, and objectives**.  
2. **Select Development Model** – Choose **Waterfall, Agile, Spiral, etc.**  
3. **Task Breakdown (WBS - Work Breakdown Structure)** – Divide the project into smaller **manageable tasks**.  
4. **Resource Allocation** – Assign **team members, tools, and technologies**.  
5. **Risk Assessment** – Identify **potential risks** and plan for mitigation.  
6. **Define Quality Assurance** – Implement **testing, reviews, and standards**.  
7. **Review and Approval** – Get **stakeholder approval** and move to execution.  

---

### **📌 2. Effort Estimation**
Effort Estimation is predicting **how much time and resources** are needed to complete a software project.  

### **🔹 Effort Estimation Techniques**
| **Method** | **Description** |
|------------|----------------|
| **LOC (Lines of Code)** | Estimates effort based on expected **lines of code**. |
| **Function Point Analysis (FPA)** | Measures **functionality** provided by the software. |
| **COCOMO Model** | Uses **mathematical formulas** to estimate cost & effort. |
| **Use Case Point Method** | Estimates based on **number & complexity** of use cases. |

---

### **📌 3. COCOMO Model (Constructive Cost Model)**
The **COCOMO** model estimates the **cost, time, and effort** based on **software size**.  

### **🔹 COCOMO Model Variants**
1. **Basic COCOMO** – Estimates effort based only on **lines of code (LOC)**.  
2. **Intermediate COCOMO** – Considers **project complexity & experience levels**.  
3. **Detailed COCOMO** – Uses **detailed cost drivers** (e.g., team skills, tools).  

### **🔹 Basic COCOMO Formula**
\[
E = a \times (KLOC)^b
\]
Where:  
- **E** = Effort in Person-Months  
- **KLOC** = Thousand Lines of Code  
- **a, b** = Constants (vary for different types of projects)

**Example:** If a project has **10 KLOC**, using **organic project type** (a=2.4, b=1.05):  
\[
E = 2.4 \times (10)^{1.05} = 25.12 \text{ person-months}
\]

---

### **📌 4. Function Point Analysis (FPA)**
FPA is used to **measure software complexity** based on user functionalities.  

### **🔹 Steps in Function Point Analysis**
1. Identify **user inputs, outputs, and files**.  
2. Assign **weights** to each function (simple, medium, complex).  
3. Calculate **Total Function Points (FP)**.  

### **🔹 Function Point Formula**
\[
FP = \sum (Inputs, Outputs, Files, Interfaces, Queries) \times Weights
\]
Higher function points mean **more effort is needed**.

---

### **📌 5. Use Case Point Method**
This method estimates effort based on **number & complexity** of **use cases**.

| **Factor** | **Weight** |
|------------|-----------|
| Simple Use Case | 5 Points |
| Average Use Case | 10 Points |
| Complex Use Case | 15 Points |

Total Effort = **Use Case Points × Productivity Factor**

---

### **🔹 Summary**
✔ **Process Planning** ensures tasks are structured, resources allocated, and risks managed.  
✔ **Effort Estimation** helps predict the cost & time needed for project completion.  
✔ **COCOMO, FPA, and Use Case Methods** are used to calculate effort.

## **Project Scheduling (PERT & CPM Charts)**  

Project scheduling is the process of defining **tasks, timelines, and dependencies** to ensure project completion within deadlines. Two widely used techniques are **PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique)** and **CPM (Critical Path Method)**.  

---

## **📌 1. PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique)**  
**PERT** is used to **estimate project duration** when **task durations are uncertain**. It is mainly used in **R&D and software projects**.  

### **🔹 Features of PERT:**  
- **Focuses on time estimation** and handles uncertainty.  
- Uses **three-time estimates** for each task:  
  - **Optimistic time (O)** – Best-case scenario.  
  - **Pessimistic time (P)** – Worst-case scenario.  
  - **Most likely time (M)** – Expected scenario.  
- Expected time for a task is calculated as:  
\[
T_E = \frac{O + 4M + P}{6}
\]
- **Critical Path**: The longest path in the PERT chart, which determines the **minimum project duration**.  

### **🔹 Steps to Create a PERT Chart**  
1. Identify project **tasks and dependencies**.  
2. Estimate **O, M, P** times for each task.  
3. Calculate the **expected time (T_E)** using the formula.  
4. Create a **network diagram** showing task sequences.  
5. Find the **Critical Path** (tasks with zero slack).  

---

## **📌 2. CPM (Critical Path Method)**  
**CPM** is used for **projects with known task durations**. It helps identify the **longest sequence of dependent tasks (critical path)** that **determines the project completion time**.  

### **🔹 Features of CPM:**  
- Used for **predictable projects** (e.g., software development).  
- **Focuses on cost and time optimization**.  
- Uses **fixed time estimates** (unlike PERT).  
- Helps identify **critical tasks** (delaying them will delay the project).  

### **🔹 Steps to Create a CPM Chart**  
1. **List all activities** and estimate their duration.  
2. Identify **dependencies** (which tasks depend on others).  
3. Create a **network diagram**.  
4. Compute **Earliest Start (ES), Latest Start (LS), Earliest Finish (EF), Latest Finish (LF)**.  
5. Find the **Critical Path** (tasks with **zero slack time**).  

### **🔹 Key CPM Formulas**
- **Earliest Finish (EF) = ES + Task Duration**  
- **Latest Start (LS) = LF – Task Duration**  
- **Slack Time = LS – ES** (If **Slack = 0**, it’s a Critical Path Task)  

---

## **📌 3. PERT vs. CPM**
| Feature | PERT | CPM |
|---------|------|-----|
| Focus | Time Management | Cost & Time Optimization |
| Duration | Uncertain (Probabilistic) | Fixed (Deterministic) |
| Time Estimation | Uses **O, M, P** | Uses **Fixed Time** |
| Used In | R&D, Software Projects | Construction, Manufacturing |

---

## **📌 4. Example of PERT & CPM**
Imagine a software development project with tasks:  
1. **Requirement Analysis** – 3 days  
2. **Design** – 5 days  
3. **Development** – 10 days  
4. **Testing** – 4 days  
5. **Deployment** – 2 days  

A possible **Critical Path**:  
**Requirement Analysis → Design → Development → Testing → Deployment (24 days)**  

---

## **🔹 Summary**
✔ **PERT is best for uncertain projects** and uses probability-based estimation.  
✔ **CPM is ideal for projects with known durations** and focuses on cost optimization.  
✔ Both methods help identify the **Critical Path**, which determines the **minimum time required** to complete a project.

---

## **📌 Types of Software Testing Strategies**  

### **1. Static Testing (Before Execution)**
- **Reviews & Inspections** → Checking **design, code, and requirements** before testing.  
- **Code Walkthroughs & Audits** → Developers review code for logical errors.  

📌 **Example:** A team reviews a **requirement document** to find missing details before coding starts.  

---

### **2. Dynamic Testing (During Execution)**
- **Black-Box Testing** → Testing **without knowing internal code** (Focus on inputs & outputs).  
- **White-Box Testing** → Testing with **knowledge of internal code structure** (Focus on logic & conditions).  

📌 **Example:**  
✔ **Black-Box Testing:** Checking if a **login page works correctly** without looking at the code.  
✔ **White-Box Testing:** A developer **writes test cases for all if-else conditions** in a function.  

---

### **3. Manual vs. Automated Testing**
- **Manual Testing** → Testers **manually execute test cases** without tools.  
- **Automated Testing** → Uses scripts & tools like **Selenium, JUnit, PyTest** to run tests faster.

✔ **Unit → Integration → System → Acceptance testing ensures a complete check.**  

---
# **Black-Box vs. White-Box Testing**  

Software testing is categorized into **Black-Box** and **White-Box** based on how much knowledge the tester has about the internal workings of the software.  

---

## **📌 1. Black-Box Testing (Behavioral Testing)**  
✅ Tester **does NOT** know the internal structure or code.  
✅ Focuses on **input-output behavior**.  
✅ Ensures software meets **functional requirements**.  

### **✔ Techniques Used:**  
🔹 **Equivalence Partitioning** → Dividing input data into valid & invalid groups.  
🔹 **Boundary Value Analysis** → Testing **edge cases** (e.g., min/max values).  
🔹 **Decision Table Testing** → Checking **rules and conditions**.  

📌 **Example:**  
If an **ATM allows withdrawals between ₹100 - ₹10,000**, black-box testing would check:  
✔ ₹50 (invalid)  
✔ ₹100 (valid)  
✔ ₹10,000 (valid)  
✔ ₹10,500 (invalid)  

---

## **📌 2. White-Box Testing (Structural Testing)**  
✅ Tester **knows** the internal structure and logic.  
✅ Focuses on **code execution paths, conditions, loops**.  
✅ Ensures **all parts of the program are tested**.  

### **✔ Techniques Used:**  
🔹 **Statement Coverage** → Every statement in code is executed at least once.  
🔹 **Branch Coverage** → Ensures **all if-else conditions** are tested.  
🔹 **Path Coverage** → Tests **all possible execution paths** in the program.  

📌 **Example:**  
A function checks **if a user is eligible for a discount**:  
```python
def discount(age):
    if age < 18:
        return "10% discount"
    elif age > 60:
        return "15% discount"
    else:
        return "No discount"
```
White-box testing would ensure:  
✔ **Age < 18** is tested  
✔ **Age > 60** is tested  
✔ **Age between 18-60** is tested  

---

## **📌 Differences Between Black-Box and White-Box Testing**  

| Feature        | Black-Box Testing | White-Box Testing |
|---------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Tester Knowledge** | No access to code | Full access to code |
| **Focus** | Input & output behavior | Internal logic & structure |
| **Used For** | Functional Testing | Unit Testing, Security Testing |
| **Techniques** | Equivalence Partitioning, Boundary Value Analysis | Statement, Branch, and Path Coverage |
| **Who Performs It?** | Testers (QA team) | Developers |

---

## **📌 Summary**  
✔ **Black-Box** tests **functionality** without knowing code.  
✔ **White-Box** tests **internal logic** and ensures **all paths are executed**.  
✔ **Both are essential for high-quality software.**  

---
# **Test Coverage Criteria (Statement, Branch, Path Coverage)**  

Test coverage criteria help measure how much of the code is tested. The three main types are **Statement Coverage, Branch Coverage, and Path Coverage**.  

---

## **📌 1. Statement Coverage**  
✅ Ensures **every statement in the code executes at least once**.  
✅ Helps find **dead code** (unused code).  

📌 **Example:**  
```c
int main() {
    int a = 5, b = 10, c;
    c = a + b;
    printf("%d", c);
    return 0;
}
```
✔ Statement coverage ensures all lines execute at least once.  

📌 **Limitations:**  
❌ Does **not** check if all conditions are tested.  
❌ May **miss logical errors**.  

---

## **📌 2. Branch Coverage (Decision Coverage)**  
✅ Ensures **each decision (if-else) has both true & false outcomes tested**.  
✅ Ensures **no branch is skipped**.  

📌 **Example:**  
```c
if (x > 0) {
    printf("Positive");
} else {
    printf("Non-positive");
}
```
✔ Tests both cases: `x > 0` (True) and `x <= 0` (False).  

📌 **Limitations:**  
❌ Does **not** test all possible execution paths.  

---

## **📌 3. Path Coverage**  
✅ Ensures **every possible execution path** is tested.  
✅ Most thorough but **hard to achieve in large programs**.  

📌 **Example:**  
```c
if (x > 0) {
    if (y > 0) {
        printf("Both positive");
    }
}
```
✔ Possible paths:  
1️⃣ `x > 0`, `y > 0` → "Both positive" prints  
2️⃣ `x > 0`, `y <= 0` → Nothing prints  
3️⃣ `x <= 0` → Nothing prints  

📌 **Limitations:**  
❌ **Too many paths** for large programs.  

---

## **📌 Comparison Table**  

| Coverage Type | What it Tests | Example |
|--------------|--------------|---------|
| **Statement Coverage** | Every line executes at least once | All lines in a function run |
| **Branch Coverage** | Each decision's true & false paths | `if` and `else` both run |
| **Path Coverage** | Every possible execution path | All combinations of branches run |

---

## **📌 Summary**  
✔ **Statement Coverage** ensures all lines run at least once.  
✔ **Branch Coverage** ensures all `if-else` conditions are tested.  
✔ **Path Coverage** ensures all **possible routes** are executed.  
✔ **More coverage = fewer bugs!**
