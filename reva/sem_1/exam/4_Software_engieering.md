## **4. Software Development Myths**

---

Software development myths are widespread but incorrect beliefs that often mislead both management and developers, resulting in unrealistic expectations, poor decisions, and failed projects.

---

### **4.1 Categories of Myths**

Software myths can be categorized into three types:

#### 1. **Management Myths**
These are false assumptions made by managers overseeing software development.

- **Myth**: “We already have a book of standards and procedures—everything will proceed smoothly.”
  - **Reality**: Standards and procedures are only useful if they are updated, tailored to the project, and followed diligently. They do not guarantee success unless enforced and accompanied by skilled resources.

- **Myth**: “Adding more people to a late project will speed it up.”
  - **Reality**: Known as Brooks’ Law — adding more people to a late software project makes it even later due to communication overhead and onboarding time.

- **Myth**: “Once we write the program and get it to work, our job is done.”
  - **Reality**: Maintenance often takes more effort than initial development. Software must be updated, corrected, and enhanced continuously.

---

#### 2. **Customer Myths**
These myths are usually believed by clients or stakeholders.

- **Myth**: “A general statement of objectives is enough to start development. We can fill in the details later.”
  - **Reality**: Unclear requirements lead to scope creep, misunderstandings, and rework. Requirements should be clearly defined and documented before development begins.

- **Myth**: “Project requirements can change at any time without affecting cost or schedule.”
  - **Reality**: Changes after project planning disrupt timelines and budgets. Every change should be analyzed for impact on cost and time.

---

#### 3. **Developer Myths**
Common misconceptions held by software engineers or programmers.

- **Myth**: “Once the program is written and works, it’s over.”
  - **Reality**: The product enters its maintenance phase. Bugs will be found, new features requested, and environments changed.

- **Myth**: “There’s no need for planning — just start coding.”
  - **Reality**: Lack of planning leads to disorganized code, missed requirements, and technical debt.

- **Myth**: “Documentation and testing are unnecessary overheads.”
  - **Reality**: Good documentation aids maintainability and collaboration. Testing is crucial to ensure quality and reliability.

---

### **4.2 Why Myths Are Dangerous**

- Create **false expectations**.
- Lead to **poor planning** and **inefficient resource allocation**.
- Cause **communication breakdown** between stakeholders and developers.
- Result in **low-quality, late, or over-budget** software products.

---

### **4.3 Busting the Myths: Good Practices**

- Educate all stakeholders about the realities of software development.
- Use iterative and incremental development processes.
- Establish strong communication and requirement clarification mechanisms.
- Practice agile and adaptive planning.
- Continuously test and document the software.

---

## **2. Functional and Non-Functional Requirements (IEEE Standard)**

---

### **2.1 Functional Requirements (FR)**

**Definition:**  
Functional Requirements specify **what the system should do**. They describe the **features, services, and behavior** of the software system under various conditions.

**Examples:**
- The system shall allow users to **register** and **log in**.
- The ATM shall **dispense cash** upon valid PIN entry.
- The system shall generate a **monthly report** of sales.

**IEEE Standard for FR:**  
According to the **IEEE 830-1998** standard, a functional requirement should:
- Be **complete** and **unambiguous**.
- Be **verifiable** (i.e., you can test it).
- Include **inputs, outputs, and behavior**.

---

### **2.2 Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)**

**Definition:**  
Non-Functional Requirements describe **how the system should behave** or place **constraints** on its functionality or design.

**Types of NFRs:**
- **Performance:** Response time, throughput, latency.
- **Reliability:** Uptime, fault tolerance, recovery time.
- **Usability:** User interface design, learnability, accessibility.
- **Security:** Authentication, encryption, user access levels.
- **Maintainability:** Modularity, documentation, code readability.
- **Scalability:** Ability to handle growth in users/data.

**Examples:**
- The system shall respond to queries within **2 seconds**.
- The system must be available **99.9%** of the time.
- Only authorized users shall access the admin panel.

**IEEE Standard for NFR:**  
NFRs should also be:
- **Measurable**
- **Testable**
- **Documented clearly** alongside functional requirements

---

### **2.3 Importance of Separating FR & NFR**

| Aspect              | Functional Requirement                   | Non-Functional Requirement                      |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Focus               | **What** the system should do            | **How** the system should behave                |
| Example             | Login feature                            | Should support 1000 users simultaneously        |
| Testability         | Unit/Functional Testing                  | Performance/Load Testing                       |
| Impact              | Direct effect on core functionality      | Affects user experience and system quality     |
---

## **3. The Software Requirements Document (SRS)**

---

### **3.1 What is an SRS?**

The **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)** is a formal document that **describes the requirements** of a software system to be developed. It is the **primary means of communication** between stakeholders (clients, developers, testers, etc.).

---

### **3.2 Purpose of SRS**

- Provides a **clear understanding** of the software product.
- Acts as a **contract** between customer and developer.
- Forms the **basis for design, development, testing, and validation**.
- Reduces misunderstandings and rework.

---

### **3.3 Characteristics of a Good SRS (As per IEEE 830 Standard)**

A well-written SRS should be:

- **Correct** – accurately describes all requirements.
- **Unambiguous** – every requirement has only one interpretation.
- **Complete** – includes all significant requirements.
- **Consistent** – no conflicting requirements.
- **Verifiable** – requirements can be checked via testing.
- **Modifiable** – can be easily updated.
- **Traceable** – each requirement is identifiable and linked to its source.

---

## **4. Requirements Specification**

---

### **4.1 What is Requirements Specification?**

Requirements Specification is the **process of documenting** the software requirements in a clear, precise, and formal manner. The result of this process is the **SRS (Software Requirements Specification)** document.

It transforms the understanding of system requirements into a structured and standardized format, ensuring developers and stakeholders are on the **same page**.

---

### **4.2 Goals of Requirements Specification**

- **Clarity**: Avoids ambiguity and ensures all parties understand the requirements the same way.
- **Precision**: Each requirement is defined in measurable terms.
- **Consistency**: No conflicting or redundant requirements.
- **Completeness**: All necessary requirements are included.
- **Verifiability**: Requirements can be tested.

---

### **4.3 Types of Requirements in Specification**

1. **Functional Requirements**
   - Describe the specific behaviors, functions, or tasks the system must perform.
   - Example: "The system shall allow users to transfer funds between accounts."

2. **Non-Functional Requirements**
   - Define how the system performs a function (performance, security, usability).
   - Example: "The system shall handle 1000 concurrent users with <1 second response time."

3. **Domain Requirements**
   - Requirements that come from the application domain and may not fit in functional/non-functional.
   - Example: "System must comply with RBI banking regulations."

---

- Helps in **better project planning and estimation**.
- Ensures the **final product meets the user’s expectations**.
---

## **6. Requirement Elicitation and Analysis**

---

Requirement elicitation and analysis is the process of collecting, discovering, and refining requirements from stakeholders and other sources. It is **one of the most critical phases** in software development — poorly elicited requirements often lead to project failure.

---

### **6.1 What is Requirement Elicitation?**

Requirement Elicitation is the process of:
- Identifying **what users need** and expect from the system.
- Understanding the **business context** and domain.
- Gathering **functional** and **non-functional** requirements.

It is not just asking users what they want — it involves exploring, observing, questioning, and validating.

---

### **6.2 Techniques for Requirement Elicitation**

1. **Interviews**
   - Direct conversation with stakeholders.
   - Types:
     - Structured (predefined questions)
     - Unstructured (free discussion)
     - Semi-structured (combination of both)

2. **Questionnaires and Surveys**
   - Written set of questions sent to a group of stakeholders.
   - Good for collecting data from a large audience.

3. **Workshops**
   - Group sessions with stakeholders.
   - Help in brainstorming and building consensus.

4. **Brainstorming**
   - Generating new ideas rapidly in a group.
   - Encourages creativity without criticism.

5. **Observation**
   - Watching users work in their environment.
   - Useful to understand **actual workflows** and not just what users say they do.

6. **Prototyping**
   - Building a simple working model of the system.
   - Helps users visualize and give better feedback.

7. **Use Case Modeling**
   - Describes interactions between users (actors) and the system.
   - Clarifies functionality and boundaries.

8. **Document Analysis**
   - Studying existing system documentation, manuals, regulations, etc.

---

### **6.3 What is Requirement Analysis?**

After gathering raw requirements, we:
- **Refine**, **organize**, and **prioritize** them.
- Detect and resolve:
  - **Conflicts** between stakeholder requirements.
  - **Ambiguities** in requirement statements.
  - **Missing or duplicate requirements**.
- Categorize them into:
  - Functional Requirements (FRs)
  - Non-functional Requirements (NFRs)
  - Domain requirements
  - Constraints

---

### **6.4 Output of Elicitation and Analysis**

- Clear and agreed-upon **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)**.
- Models like:
  - Use Case Diagrams
  - Data Flow Diagrams
  - Entity-Relationship Diagrams
- Traceability Matrix (to track each requirement to its source)

---

### **6.5 Challenges in Elicitation**

- Stakeholders may not know exactly what they want.
- Stakeholders may have **conflicting needs**.
- **Technical vocabulary** mismatch between users and developers.
- Time constraints.
- Poor communication.

---

### **6.6 Best Practices**

- Engage all types of stakeholders: end-users, managers, technical staff.
- Use **visual models** and **prototypes** early.
- Keep detailed **records and documentation** of each session.
- **Validate requirements frequently** with stakeholders.
---

## **7. Requirements Validation**

---

Requirements validation is the process of **checking that the gathered requirements define the correct system**, are **complete**, **consistent**, **unambiguous**, and that **they meet the needs of the stakeholders**.

It ensures the software being developed will solve the actual problems and fulfill the users’ expectations.

---

### **7.1 Why is Validation Important?**

- **Requirements errors** are the **most expensive to fix** if found late.
- Prevents:
  - Incomplete or incorrect features
  - Wasted development effort
  - User dissatisfaction
- A validated SRS (Software Requirements Specification) is a **formal agreement** between users and developers.

---

### **7.2 Techniques of Requirements Validation**

1. **Reviews**
   - Manual examination of the requirements by stakeholders.
   - Types:
     - **Informal Reviews** – casual discussion
     - **Walkthroughs** – guided by the author of the SRS
     - **Inspections** – formal, documented checking

2. **Prototyping**
   - Early working model of the system is shown to users.
   - Helps validate that the right functionality is being built.

3. **Test Case Generation**
   - Writing test cases for requirements helps identify ambiguities and gaps.
   - Each requirement should be **testable**.

4. **Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM)**
   - Ensures **each requirement** is accounted for and linked to design, code, and test cases.

5. **Stakeholder Validation**
   - Users and domain experts review and confirm the requirements.

---

### **7.3 Characteristics of Valid Requirements**

| **Development Environment** | IDEs, frameworks, and automation tools |

---

### **9.3 Cost Estimation Techniques**

---

#### 1. **Expert Judgment**
- Based on prior experience of similar projects
- Quick but subjective

#### 2. **Analogous Estimation**
- Compares with past similar projects
- Requires historical data

#### 3. **Top-down Estimation**
- Estimate based on overall functionality or project type
- Less detailed, fast for early planning

#### 4. **Bottom-up Estimation**
- Break project into smaller tasks, estimate each, then sum
- More accurate but time-consuming

#### 5. **Parametric Models**
- Use mathematical models and historical data
- Examples: **COCOMO**, **Function Point Analysis**

---

### **9.4 COCOMO Model (Constructive Cost Model)**

Developed by **Barry Boehm**, COCOMO estimates:
- **Effort (person-months)**
- **Time (months)**
- Based on **Lines of Code (LOC)**

#### Basic COCOMO Formula:

**Effort (E)** = a × (KLOC)^b  
**Time (T)** = c × (E)^d  

Where:  
- KLOC = 1000s of Delivered Source Instructions  
- Constants **a, b, c, d** depend on project type: Organic, Semi-detached, or Embedded

| Mode         | a   | b    | c   | d    |
|--------------|-----|------|-----|------|
| Organic      | 2.4 | 1.05 | 2.5 | 0.38 |
| Semi-detached| 3.0 | 1.12 | 2.5 | 0.35 |
| Embedded     | 3.6 | 1.20 | 2.5 | 0.32 |

---

### **9.5 Example (Using Basic COCOMO)**

For a 50 KLOC Organic project:

- **Effort** = 2.4 × (50)^1.05 ≈ 2.4 × 56.2 = **134.88 person-months**  
- **Time** = 2.5 × (134.88)^0.38 ≈ 2.5 × 7.1 = **17.75 months**

---

### **9.6 Estimation Tools**

- **COCOMO Calculator**
- **SEER-SEM**
- **Price Systems**
- **Function Point Analysis Tools**
- **MS Project (with estimation plugins)**

---

## **10. Requirements Modelling**

---

Requirements modelling is the process of **representing requirements visually or mathematically** to better understand, validate, and communicate system needs.

It bridges the gap between **user requirements** and **system design**.

---

### **10.1 Purpose of Requirements Modelling**

- **Visualizes** functional and non-functional requirements
- Helps **refine and validate** requirements
- Provides input to the **design and implementation**
- Supports **communication** among stakeholders

---

### **10.2 Types of Models**

---

#### 1. **Context Model**
- Shows the **boundary** of the system
- Represents how the system **interacts with external entities** (actors, systems)
- Often drawn using **context diagrams** (a type of data flow diagram)

---

#### 2. **Behavioral Models**
- Describe **what the system does** in response to inputs or events

**Examples:**
- **Use Case Diagrams (UML):** Show how users interact with the system  
- **State Diagrams:** Show transitions between states  
- **Activity Diagrams:** Show workflows of operations

---

#### 3. **Structural Models**
- Represent the **static structure** of data and system components

**Examples:**

- Enhances **communication**
- Facilitates **better design and implementation**
---

## **11. Design Concepts**

---

Software design is the process of **transforming requirements** into a **blueprint** for constructing the software system. Key concepts of design guide how this transformation should happen to ensure a good, reliable, and maintainable product.

---

### **11.1 Fundamental Design Concepts**

---

#### 1. **Abstraction**
- Simplifying complex reality by modeling classes appropriate to the problem.
- Focus on **what** an object does, not **how** it does it.

**Example:**  
A “Car” class may have a `start()` method without showing the internal mechanism of starting the engine.

---

#### 2. **Modularity**
- Dividing the system into manageable, independent modules.
- Each module performs a specific function.

**Benefits:**  
- Easier to develop and test  
- Promotes reuse  
- Increases maintainability

---

#### 3. **Architecture**
- Describes the **overall structure** of the system and the way components interact.
- Common architectural styles:  
  - Layered architecture  
  - Client-server  
  - Microservices  
  - MVC (Model-View-Controller)

---

#### 4. **Refinement**
- The process of elaborating high-level specifications into more detailed designs.
- Top-down approach: Start from abstract to concrete levels.

---

#### 5. **Information Hiding**
- Internal details of modules are hidden from other modules.
- Only interfaces are exposed.

**Benefits:**  
- Reduces system complexity  
- Enhances modularity and security

---

#### 6. **Cohesion**
- The **degree to which the elements inside a module belong together**.

**High cohesion** is desirable.

**Types of cohesion:**  
- Functional (best)  
- Sequential  
- Communicational  
- Procedural  
- Temporal  
- Logical  
- Coincidental (worst)

---

#### 7. **Coupling**
- The **degree of interdependence** between software modules.

**Low coupling** is desirable.

**Types of coupling:**  
- Data (best)  
- Stamp  
- Control  
- Common  
- Content (worst)

---

#### 8. **Design for Change**
- Software should be designed in a way that it can **accommodate future changes** easily.

---

#### 9. **Reusability**
- Design components so they can be **reused** in other systems or parts of the same system.

---

#### 10. **Design Quality Attributes**
- Correctness  
- Efficiency  
- Flexibility  
- Maintainability  
- Portability  
- Reusability  
- Robustness  
- Scalability

---

## **12. Function-Oriented Design**

---

Function-Oriented Design (FOD) is a traditional approach that focuses on **functions or procedures** rather than data. It is **process-centric**, emphasizing the transformation of input data into output through a sequence of processing steps.

---

### **12.1 What is Function-Oriented Design?**

- The design revolves around a **set of functions** that operate on data.
- It breaks down the system into **modules**, each performing a specific task.
- Commonly used in **structured programming** (e.g., C language).

---

### **12.2 Characteristics of Function-Oriented Design**

- **Top-down decomposition:**  
  Start with the highest-level function, then decompose into smaller sub-functions.
  
- **Data Flow Diagrams (DFD):**  
  Used to represent the flow of data and processes in the system.
  
- **Emphasis on actions/functions** rather than the entities on which functions operate.

---

### **12.3 Design Methodology**

1. **Develop a Data Flow Diagram (DFD)**  
   - Shows how input data is transformed into output through processes.
   - Levels:  
     - Context-level DFD (Level 0)  
     - Level 1 DFD  
     - Level 2 DFD (and so on…)

2. **Identify Modules from DFD**  
   - Each process in DFD becomes a module or submodule.

3. **Structure Chart Design**  
   - Visual representation of the system’s modular structure.
   - Shows function-call relationships between modules.
   - Uses **arrows** and **modules** in a tree format.

---

### **12.4 Key Concepts in FOD**

- **Module:** Independent unit that performs a specific function.
- **Control Hierarchy:** The arrangement of modules (top-down or bottom-up).
- **Fan-in:** Number of modules that call a specific module.
- **Fan-out:** Number of modules a specific module calls.
- **Transaction Centre:** A module that handles different types of input data using different paths.

---

### **12.5 Strengths of Function-Oriented Design**

- Easy to understand for simple systems.
- Well-supported by structured programming languages.
- Good for systems that can be clearly decomposed into processes.

---

### **12.6 Limitations**

#### 3. **Analogy-Based Estimation**
- Compares the current project to similar past projects.
- Adjusts effort estimates based on differences in size, complexity, or team skill.

#### 4. **Algorithmic/Model-Based Estimation**
- Uses mathematical models with input variables like size (LOC, FP), complexity, etc.
- Examples:
  - **COCOMO (Constructive Cost Model)**:  
    - Basic COCOMO:  
      $$ \text{Effort} = a \times (\text{KLOC})^b $$
      where `a` and `b` are constants depending on project type.
    - Intermediate and Detailed COCOMO include more cost drivers and factors.

---

### **COCOMO I - Basic Model Example**

For an organic project (simple, small teams, familiar domain):
- \( a = 2.4 \), \( b = 1.05 \)  
- If the estimated size is 10 KLOC:

  $$
  \text{Effort} = 2.4 \times (10)^{1.05} \approx 26.87 \text{ person-months}
  $$

Suppose multiple developers are working on the same module. SCM ensures:

- They don’t overwrite each other’s changes.
- A history of who changed what is maintained.
- If a bug arises, a previous stable version can be restored.
- The final build can be confidently reproduced.

### **The SPI Process (Software Process Improvement Process)**

---

The **Software Process Improvement (SPI) Process** is a **structured series of steps** that guide an organization through the evaluation, planning, implementation, and refinement of improvements to its software development process.

---

### **1. Overview of the SPI Process**

The SPI process follows a **systematic improvement lifecycle**, often modeled using frameworks like **PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act)** or tailored models like **IDEAL** (Initiating, Diagnosing, Establishing, Acting, Learning).

---

### **2. IDEAL Model for SPI**

A widely accepted model for SPI is the **IDEAL model**, defined by SEI (Software Engineering Institute). It provides a five-phase roadmap for improvement:

| **Phase**      | **Purpose**                                                                 |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **I - Initiating**     | Lay the groundwork for SPI by building support and identifying needs |
| **D - Diagnosing**     | Assess the current process and analyze gaps                          |
| **E - Establishing**   | Develop an action plan and prioritize improvements                   |
| **A - Acting**         | Implement improvements and pilot changes                             |
| **L - Learning**       | Analyze results, capture lessons learned, and prepare for iteration  |

  - **ISO 9001 (Quality Management)**
  - **Automotive SPICE (for embedded systems)**

Compliance adds structure and credibility to SPI efforts.

---

### **e) Custom SPI Frameworks**

- Instead of one-size-fits-all models, companies design their **tailored SPI frameworks** suited to their size, domain, and culture.

---

## **2. Return on Investment (ROI) in SPI**

Investing in SPI requires resources — time, money, and effort. ROI determines whether the investment yields **measurable business value**.

---

### **a) What is ROI in SPI?**

**ROI (Return on Investment)** is the benefit gained from an SPI initiative, expressed in terms of:

- **Cost savings** (less rework, fewer defects)
- **Productivity improvements**
- **Time-to-market reduction**
- **Customer satisfaction**
- **Employee morale**

---

### **b) ROI Calculation (Simplified)**

Let’s say:

- Cost of SPI = ₹5,00,000 (training, tools, time)
- Benefits:
  - Saved ₹3,00,000 in reduced rework
  - Saved ₹2,00,000 in improved delivery speed

Then:

```text
ROI (%) = [(Total Benefit - SPI Cost) / SPI Cost] × 100
        = [(₹5,00,000 - ₹5,00,000) / ₹5,00,000] × 100 = 0%
```

But if benefits exceed cost:

```text
ROI = [(₹7,00,000 - ₹5,00,000)/₹5,00,000] × 100 = 40%
```

---

### **c) Measuring SPI ROI in Practice**

| **Metric**                      | **Before SPI** | **After SPI** |
|-------------------------------|----------------|---------------|
| Defect Rate (per KLOC)         | 15             | 5             |
| Schedule Overrun (%)           | 25%            | 5%            |
| Customer Complaints per Month  | 10             | 2             |
| Developer Productivity (FP/mo) | 30             | 50            |

These improvements clearly demonstrate **quantifiable ROI**.

---

### **d) Factors Influencing ROI**

- **Maturity of current process**
- **Team experience**
- **Management support**
- **Scope of SPI implementation**
- **Use of tools and automation**

---

### **e) Long-Term ROI**

Even though SPI may have **short-term costs**, long-term benefits include:

- **Better project predictability**
- **Higher quality software**
- **Reduced employee burnout**
