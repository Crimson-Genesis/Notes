- The Board of directors at an international financial serviees orginisation, headquartered in london with offices in financial centries throughout the world, including Paris, New York and Hong Kong, were considering a confidential merger offer.
- On a Friday afternoon, before a three-day weekend, the CIO received a ransom wmail from an unknown source stating they knew about the marger plane and had personal details of 150,000 customers. A sample of personal details of 500 customers was included in the ransom email as "proof". Unless a significant ransom was paid in the Bitcoin, they would leak the merger plan and sell the customer information. Herbert Smit Freehills was immediately engaged as legal counsel to manage and advise on the incident response and stated work immediately, aided by forensic computer specilists, to assess and contain the threat.
- FIRST RESPONSE Teh first step was to validate the threat. We found a discussion on a hacker site in the dark-net that reveled personal information of 150,000 account holders of the out client wae available for sale, with the same 500 customers details provided as a "sample".
- At the same time, and within a few hours, we had also preserved the relevant server logs and quickly identified and neutralised malware found on out clients's network. During that time, we had to assume that internal communications were subject to cavesdropping so secure channels were used between the client, lawyers and forensic investigators.
- A careful review of the sample compromised data ensued to confirm if in fact sensitive personal information of our client's customer base had indeed been taken. Due to international nature of this investigation, we were careful not to export data across borders without appropriate safeguard in place e.g., the US is not a safe harbour for the purposes of the EU data protection regime unless the entited concerned were signed up to the UD Department of Commerce Safe Harbour Scheme. The investigations confirmed that the information for the 500 customers was genuine. Server logs revealed that it had been extracted a few days earlier. In this case, fortunately, it was only UK customers that were affected. However, scrutiny of the server logs revealed no evidence that 150,000 customers details had been taken: the evidence pointed only to the 500 cutomers details attached to the original rensom email having been taken.
- Consideration was therefore given to whether or not the hackers were actually bluffing, boht as the suggestion that they had 150,000 customers details but also as to the merger plans. There had been speculation in the press anyway about he ptoential deal, and there was no evidence from the forensic scurutiny of out client's systems that e-main or other sensitive documents had abtually been accessed.

- As there were variout offenses being committed not least computer misuse act offences and blackmail, we reported to the police and to action Frud in the UK. Guidance was also sought from the National Cyber Crime Unit and CERT-UK(National Computer Emergency Response Team).
- CERT-UK advised that, in fact, one other company had been targeted with a similar demand and that reference had been made there to merger plans even thuogh nothing was being considered for that company - in ohter words, there was a possibility that the hackers had mentioned merger plans without actually knowing there ere any, bnut instead just on the off-chance that there might be, with this in mind, the decisions was made not to pay the ransom and to ride out the storm, However, it was still necessary to deal with the 500 customers details that had been published.
- We considered the need to notify the data subjects whose data had been compromised The data involved was the customers names, physical home addresses, e-mail address, home phone number and dates of birth. This data is of extremely high utility to hackers: the opportunity for identity theft or social engineering-based attacks was significant. This risk could be reduced by infoming the data subjects and so it was agreed that the data subjects should be notified and given practical guidance on how to reduce that risk of identity froud. Prior to sending out the notification e-mails, the bank's customer service line was briefed on the situation so they could deal with queries, but also brieded to be on the lookout for social engineering attacks using the information (such as prople phoning up pretending to be customers). A press briefing was also prepared. It was also in practice necessary to notify both the Information Commissioners Office and the Financial Conduct Autherity, and this was dome within 23 hours of receiving the original ransome e-mail, and before notifiying the affected data subjects.
- Careful management of communications needed to be maintained throughout the investigation - not just at the start. The key was to be transprent: the press release would be scrutinised by security professionals, the regulators and the data subjects themselves so we ensured that the message was right from a technical, legal and commercial point of view. Data breaches evalve as further facts come to light so we also ensured that the relevent parties were kept up to date and provided advice to affected customers to increase their online security.
