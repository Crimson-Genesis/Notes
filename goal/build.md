## 🛠️ Tiered Project Roadmap for System Development Engineers

---

### 🌱 **Foundational Projects (You Can Start Now)**
**Goal:** Master systems thinking, memory, processes, and file handling.

| Project                        | What You’ll Learn                         |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| ✅ Build Your Own Shell        | Process management, signals, I/O, fork/exec |
| ✅ Simple File System (in C)   | Low-level file operations, block design    |
| ✅ Memory Allocator (malloc)   | Heap management, pointers, fragmentation   |
| ✅ Mini HTTP Server (in C/C++) | Sockets, threading, protocols              |
| ✅ Build a CLI Tool (like `cat`, `grep`) | File I/O, command-line parsing     |

---

### 🌿 **Intermediate Projects (Resume-Grade)**
**Goal:** Show that you understand architecture, performance, and OS-level design.

| Project                                 | What You’ll Learn                                       |
|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 🚀 Custom Kernel Module (Linux)         | Kernel-space programming, interrupts, hardware interfacing |
| 🚀 Multithreaded Downloader             | Thread pool, HTTP parsing, synchronization               |
| 🚀 Process Scheduler Simulation (RR, SJF)| Threading, queuing theory, system behavior               |
| 🚀 Virtual Memory Simulator             | Paging, segmentation, TLB simulation                     |
| 🚀 In-Memory Key-Value Store (like Redis)| Data structures, network sockets, protocol parsing       |

### 🌳 **Advanced Projects (For Top Offers ₹30L–₹1Cr+)**
**Goal:** Demonstrate deep expertise, originality, and system-scale thinking.

| Project                                  | What You’ll Master                                       |
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 🧠 Design Your Own Tiny OS (xv6-level)     | Bootloader, paging, process mgmt, syscalls                |
| 🔄 Build a Git Clone (partial)            | File trees, hashing, object model, CLI, performance       |
| 📡 Peer-to-Peer Chat System               | Protocol design, NAT traversal, concurrency               |
| ⚙️ Dynamic Binary Translator (JIT Engine) | Compiler theory, memory protection, CPU instructions      |
| 🧪 Chaos Monkey for Linux                 | System resilience, fault injection, daemon writing        |

### 🌐 Bonus: Open Source Contribution Targets

- Linux Kernel (small patches)
- Redis (add feature or fix bug)
- SQLite (understand and document internals)
- cURL (libcurl additions)
- FreeBSD / NetBSD networking stack

---

## 🚧 How to Stand Out Even More:
- Document every project with a **clean README**
- Add **diagrams** explaining the design
- Write a **blog post** on what you learned
- Push to GitHub → share on LinkedIn + Reddit

## 🧭 Where to Go Next?

Would you like:
1. A Notion template / tracker for managing these projects?
2. A GitHub repo scaffold to get started with these builds?
3. A weekly study/project schedule based on your college routine?
