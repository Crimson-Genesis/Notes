In Python, the `typecode` is an attribute of the `array` object from the `array` module. It specifies the type of elements stored in the array. Each `typecode` is a single character representing a specific C data type.

### Example Usage:
```python
import array

# Creating an array of integers
arr = array.array('i', [1, 2, 3, 4])
print("Array typecode:", arr.typecode)
```

### Common Typecodes:
| Typecode | C Type        | Python Type | Size (bytes) |
|----------|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| `'b'`    | signed char   | int         | 1            |
| `'B'`    | unsigned char | int         | 1            |
| `'u'`    | wchar_t       | Unicode     | 2 or 4       |
| `'h'`    | signed short  | int         | 2            |
| `'H'`    | unsigned short| int         | 2            |
| `'i'`    | signed int    | int         | 2 or 4       |
| `'I'`    | unsigned int  | int         | 2 or 4       |
| `'l'`    | signed long   | int         | 4            |
| `'L'`    | unsigned long | int         | 4            |
| `'f'`    | float         | float       | 4            |
| `'d'`    | double        | float       | 8            |

### Notes:
- The `typecode` ensures that all elements in the array are of the same type.
- Using `array.array` is more memory-efficient than Python lists for numeric data.
